    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Geological field observations, coupled with laboratory methods including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry, electron microprobe, Raman spectroscopy, and cathodoluminescence, were used to solve the complex problem of the origin of automorphic feldspars and coexisting silicates and aluminosilicates dispersed in the Late Cretaceous Ashua limestones and their metamorphosed crystalline varieties in southern Peru. Petrographic and geochemical data reveal at least three distinct generations of feldspar. The earliest generations of consistent crystallographic orientation (albite A cores and B rims), commonly associated with sericite and adularia, are interpreted as magmatic to postmagmatic in origin. They derived from pyroclastic material of the Early Cretaceous Matalaque Formation within the West Peruvian Trough. Albite grains, introduced as volcaniclastic detritus, are found both in the siliciclastic deposits of the Ashua and/or Chilcane formations and sporadically in restricted, evaporitic marine carbonate environments where celestite, barite, and opal A also precipitated. The outermost regeneration rim (albite-oligoclase composition; generation C), exhibiting distinct crystallographic orientations, conferred the automorphic habit to the feldspars within the contact aureole of the Paleogene Chejol hypabyssal dacite intrusion. It crystallized within metasomatic assemblages representative of skarns, alkali-amphibole, and aceite-type metasomatites, as well as propylitic facies, which formed under conditions ranging from ∼500 °C to 150 °C at near-neutral pH (∼8).As the main cations involved in the three-phased processes are Na, K, Mg, and Ca, this feldspar-C generation was associated with cogenetic minerals in crystalline limestone hosts. Al-rich titanite, Mg-chlorite, talc, and authigenic quartz characterize the earliest hydrothermal pulse. The subsequent hydrothermal episode led to the zeolitization and albitization, followed by the formation of quartz pseudomorphs after stilbite and albite.</span>",

    "summary": "<div>The concept of the bio-inorganic bridge links the evolution of Earth's biosphere to the broad-scale changes in trace metal availability driven by shifts in ocean redox conditions. This framework connects the acquisition of metal enzyme cofactors to evolving environmental conditions over geological time. Various approaches have been taken to building this bridge, integrating insights from microbiology, phylogenomics, ecophysiology, and geochemistry. Much of this work has been framed around a model of Earth's oceans evolving from an Archean anoxic state, through an intermediate sulfidic phase, to the well-oxygenated conditions of the modern world. This perspective predicts corresponding changes in the abundance of key trace elements and highlights their roles in governing primary productivity and the emergence of eukaryotes. That said, geological proxy studies in the intervening years revealed much more complexity to ocean redox evolution, while novel phylogenomic analyses reveal a deeper evolutionary antiquity for several redox-sensitive metalloenzymes. These discoveries require that geobiologists pay close attention to environmental variations in space as well as time. Moreover, increasing awareness that Precambrian trace metal abundances reflect large changes in sources and sinks, as well as in redox conditions, urges closer attention to tectonically influenced fluxes of major nutrients, especially phosphorus, as well as changing weathering fluxes through time. A new understanding of the relationships between Earth's physical history and metalloenzymes awaits.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The bio-inorganic bridge connects biological and geological evolution through changes in trace metal availability over Earth's history.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Combining sedimentary geochemistry and phylogenetics has revealed novel insights into metal utilization by the biosphere.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Interdisciplinary approaches are increasingly used to link biosphere evolution with Earth's surface environments.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

In contrast, biological systems have evolved highly efficient, adaptive, and sustainable energy management strategies over billions of years. This review introduces ‘Life Cells (LCs)’, bio-inspired batteries designed to replicate these biological principles, enabling autonomous energy acquisition, conversion, storage, and utilization. We examine their core mechanisms, biomimetic materials, and system architectures. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges, strategies, and future opportunities for advancing LC technology and its potential applications in next-generation sustainable energy solutions.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Climate warming alters the start (SOS) and end (EOS) of growing seasons, impacting biotic interactions and biogeochemical cycles. Yet, the carry-over links between SOS and EOS remain poorly understood, limiting future projections. Using MODIS satellite-derived phenology data for seasonal vegetation and European ground observations for deciduous tree species, we show that an earlier SOS typically advances the EOS (on average by 0.19 ± 0.001 days per day [MODIS] and 0.10 ± 0.002 days per day [ground]), while EOS exerts a weaker influence on subsequent SOS. The SOS-to-EOS effect often outweighed abiotic factors, with SOS emerging as the best predictor of EOS in 34% of pixels (β = 0.27). When predicting SOS, EOS was the primary predictor in only 7.9% of pixels, while preseason temperature dominated in 58% (β = -0.33). More importantly, we identified a dampening interaction, where an increase in one carry-over effect reduced the other. Thus, the SOS-to-EOS effect was twice as strong as the EOS-to-SOS effect in temperate deciduous forests, while the EOS-to-SOS effect was up to three times stronger in boreal taiga and tundra. This likely reflects developmental (cell and tissue growth) and stress-related constraints (SOS-to-EOS effect), as well as chilling requirements (EOS-to-SOS effect at high latitudes). These findings highlight how physiological feedbacks affect phenological responses to climate change, emphasizing the need to integrate plant-internal carry-over effects into future ecosystem models.</span>",

Here, we developed a new process-based model integrating daily water balance dynamics with carbonate chemical equilibria at a 10 cm vertical resolution to predict the effects of climate change on the SIC pool down to a soil depth of 2 m in China until 2100. We found across the four shared socioeconomic pathways, SIC stock in China’s topsoil (0–10 cm) decreased by 314 ± 8 Tg C, accompanied by a loss of 217 ± 9 Tg C from the 2 m soils. These findings challenge the traditional view of SIC stability in terrestrial carbon cycles, reveal substantial losses of SIC in both topsoils and deep soils, and highlight the projection of future climate and global inorganic carbon cycle feedbacks.</span>",

This approach integrates the decomposition of Spectral Granger Causality and quantifies the lifespan trajectories of spectral processes. Using Bayesian inversion on cross-spectral rsEEG data from 1,965 participants aged 5-100 years (HarMNqEEG dataset), the model estimates cortical activity showing high test-retest reliability, effective connectivity patterns, and conduction delays. Given the approximate cortical hierarchy inferred from the inverted T1w/T2w myelination map, used as a proxy for feedforward and feedback organization, the aperiodic and α components reveal opposite directional networks across the lifespan, where the aperiodic component is localized in the frontal cortex and the α component is localized in the posterior cortex, with feedforward and feedback directed connections, respectively. For both processes, we found that the spectral parameters follow a nonlinear inverted U-shape lifespan trajectory. Finally, the model uniquely estimates global conduction delays, which were negatively correlated with α frequency and with independent cortical myelination (T1w/T2w) measures, consistent with a mechanistic link between conduction delays and α-rhythm modulation.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Numerous mechanisms have been theorized to account for the natural fractionation of antimony (Sb). However, empirical evidence to substantiate and elucidate the intricacies of these processes remain scarce. Herein, we conduct a series of laboratory experiments aimed to better constrain direction and extent of fractionation induced by these geologically prominent mechanisms. In the weathering experiment of stibnite, neither ultrapure water (MQ) nor 0.5N HNO<sub>3</sub> induced distinguishable Sb isotopic fractionation beyond analytical uncertainty. By contrast, weathering with 0.4N HCl resulted in a significant enrichment of heavier Sb isotopes in leachate. Follow-up leaching experiments with HCl across a range of pH conditions confirmed that for native Sb, lower pH enhances fractionation, while for stibnite, the fractionation is largely independent of pH. These collective results reveal that the direction and magnitude of Sb isotopic fractionation are significantly influenced by ligand species in solution, pH conditions and specific Sb-bearing mineral species during leaching (or weathering) process. Notably, the chloric ligand exhibits a greater capacity to dissolve, transport and fractionate Sb than nitric ligand or ultrapure water, which lead to leachates observably enrich in heavier Sb isotopes relative to starting minerals with ∆<sup>123</sup>Sb<sub>Leaching solution–Starting mineral</sub> ≤ 0.52‰. Regarding the evaporation and precipitation experiments, while no discernible Sb isotopic fractionation was observed, combined with previous related research, several noteworthy insights were nonetheless gleaned. In detail, the valence state of antimony ions, species of anion in solution, temperature and heating duration all contribute to effecting Sb isotopic fractionation during evaporation process. Meanwhile, key factors that influence redox-controlled Sb isotopic fractionation include the valence states of antimony, chemical bond types, biotic or abiotic environment, medium species. Importantly, the findings of this study will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms behind Sb isotopic fractionation, and thereby aiding in the interpretation of Sb isotopic system in geological research.</span>",

Here, we present a multi-technique investigation that reveals unprecedented insights into the crystallization pathways of magnesium sulfate hydrates. We identify a previously unrecognized bond length inversion phenomenon that fundamentally challenges conventional crystallization models by integrating time-resolved Raman spectroscopy, X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and density functional theory calculations. Contrary to common assumptions, we demonstrate that S-O bonds in magnesium sulfate are shorter in the liquid phase (1.43-1.44 Å) compared to crystalline phases (1.47 Å), indicating that crystal packing forces extend bond lengths beyond their solution-phase preferences. The systematic splitting of the SO<sub>4</sub> ν<sub>1</sub> symmetric stretch vibration into distinct components (ν<sub>1h</sub> and ν<sub>1w</sub>) correlates directly with measured S-O bond length distributions, providing spectroscopic fingerprints of the local coordination environments that evolve during crystallization. Our data reveal that crystallization proceeds through the progressive organization of hydrated clusters containing Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub> octahedra surrounded by SO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra, with water activity controlling the sequential formation of increasingly dehydrated phases. Significantly, we observe structural reorganization during crystal maturation, evidenced by an inversion point where bond length relationships between dissolved and crystalline species reverse after approximately 350 minutes. These findings provide experimental evidence supporting non-classical nucleation theories, including two-step nucleation and pre-nucleation cluster pathways, while offering molecular-level explanations for Ostwald’s rule of stages. Beyond advancing crystallization science, our results have important implications for interpreting the environmental history of magnesium sulfate deposits on Earth and Mars, and for developing strategies to control crystallization pathways in materials synthesis and processing in ancient and modern lacustrine environments.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Prehnite (Ca<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>) is a common mineral in low-grade (prehnite-pumpellyite facies) metamorphic rocks and hydrothermally altered igneous rocks. It has a unique crystal structure containing two types of tetrahedral sites, T1 (occupied by only Si) linked with two neighboring T2 tetrahedra and two AlO<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> octahedra, and T2 (occupied by equal Si and Al) linked to two other T2 tetrahedra in a helical chain and two T1 tetrahedra. Although most X-ray diffraction studies refined the crystal structure in space group <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span>2<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cm</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span>2/<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">n</span> with an ordered alternating Si-Al distribution in the T2 chains, discrepancies have been noted between experimentally determined phase boundaries and those calculated thermodynamically, which have been discussed in terms of Si-Al disorder. We performed one- and two- dimensional <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>29</sup>Si and <sup>27</sup>Al NMR measurements on natural and synthetic prehnite samples used in previous thermodynamic and experimental studies, and first-principles calculations to clarify the issue. Our <sup>29</sup>Si NMR results revealed an extra peak near −103.1 ppm for Si in the T2 sites with one less Al next-nearest neighbors (NNN) (i.e., 3Si,1Al) than the main peak near −98.8 ppm for T2 sites (2Si, 2Al NNN), indicative of some local Si-Al disorder within the silicate chains violating the Al-avoidance principle for the synthetic prehnite, but not the natural prehnite samples. This suggests the synthetic samples may not have reached an equilibrium state, possibly due to slow kinetics at the relatively low experimental temperatures (400 and 545 °C). The data also revealed a pair of extra <sup>29</sup>Si NMR peaks near −80.5 and −88.5 ppm attributable to Si in T1 sites with 2Al and 2Si NNN, respectively, in addition to a main peak near −84.6 ppm attributable to Si in T1 sites with 1Al and 1Si NNN as expected in an ordered structure, for all the samples. For the natural prehnite samples, these extra peaks may be explained by the presence of a different type of Si-Al disorder, i.e., Si-Al exchange in the T2 chains under the constraint of strict alternating Si-Al (chain disorder). Such a chain disorder was found by first-principles calculation to cause significantly less enthalpy increase than local Si-Al disorder that violates the Al-avoidance. It could be a common phenomenon for natural silicate minerals, but is rarely detectable for other minerals. Its detection for prehnite was rendered possible because this mineral has an unusual structure in which the local environments of the T1 sites are sensitive to chain disorder of the T2 chains. Our first-principles calculations reproduced the observed <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>29</sup>Si and <sup>27</sup>Al NMR results well, and also revealed that the two ordered structures of prehnite with space groups <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span>2<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cm</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span>2/<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">n</span> only differ slightly in enthalpy and NMR parameters. This is consistent with the previously reported coexistence of domains of both space groups in natural prehnite from various localities. The existence of two modifications with the same topology and ordered Si-Al distribution, differing only in how some of the equivalent Si and Al sites are distributed, is unique among silicate minerals.</span>",

Inspired by the framework of traditional Chinese lanterns, the electrode expands uniformly within the ventricle and conforms to the ependymal wall. Compared with conventional subdural ECoG electrodes, the LV-BCI shows superior signal stability and immunocompatibility. Resting-state spectral analyses revealed a maximum effective bandwidth comparable to subdural ECoG. In evoked potential tests, the LV-BCI maintained a consistently higher signal-to-noise ratio over 112 days without the decline typically associated with scarring or other immune responses. Immunohistochemistry showed only a transient, early microglial activation after implantation, returning to control levels and remaining stable through 168 days. We further designed an “action-memory T-maze” task and developed a microstate sequence classifier (MSSC) to predict rats’ left/right turn decisions. The LV-BCI achieved prediction accuracy up to 98%, significantly outperforming subdural ECoG, indicating enhanced access to decision-related information from deep structures such as the hippocampus. These results establish the lateral ventricle as a viable route for neural signal acquisition. Using a lantern-inspired flexible electrode, we achieve long-term stable recordings and robust memory-guide decision decoding from within the ventricular system, opening new directions for BCI technology and systems neuroscience.</span>",

Here, we employ PbS quantum dots (QDs) as near-infrared-II (NIR-II) absorbers and precisely modulate the CdS shell to balance the triplet exciton transfer efficiency with the triplet lifetime of the surface ligands, thereby enhancing the overall sensitization performance of the hybrid photosensitizer. Coupled with rubrene as the annihilator, a record upconversion efficiency of 3.9% was achieved under 1064 nm excitation. Furthermore, the efficient upconversion material enables unprecedented beyond 1000 nm low-energy sunlight-driven large-volume photocatalysis, applicable to both free radical polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization.

Here, we propose a transparent metasurface as smart window that bridges this gap by generating self-accelerating Weber beams for robust in-vehicle wireless communications. Fabricated via a low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) process on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, the smart window achieves 73.5% optical transmittance and efficient microwave cross-polarization conversion. Two beam types, i.e. orthogonal and semi-auto-focusing Weber beams, are tailored for lateral and rear windshield integration, both exhibiting self-bending and self-healing capabilities. In real-world vehicle cabin tests, the metasurface-enhanced system significantly improves the link reliability under physical obstruction, yielding an average enhanced power of 8.37 dB and reduced bit error rate below 1% with successful high-fidelity RGB image reconstruction. This work establishes a practical framework for transparent electromagnetic interfaces that dynamically reroute the wireless signals, with promising applications in smart vehicles, building-integrated communications, biomedical devices, and industrial Internet of Things.</span>",

Topological semimetals provide an attractive platform because they combine metallic conductivity with topological states that can efficiently generate spin currents. However, while most studied systems rely on accidental band inversions, the SOT response of symmetry-enforced Dirac semimetals remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the nonsymmorphic symmetry-enforced Dirac semimetal hexagonal SrIrO<sub>3</sub> exhibits record-high SOT efficiency. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In-situ</span> angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on high-quality epitaxial thin films directly confirmed the topological Dirac semimetal state, revealing bulk Dirac points near the Fermi level and spin-momentum locked surface states.

Their remarkable features include fractionalized elementary excitations, gapless boundary states, and nontrivial quantum entanglement patterns. Thanks to the persistent efforts of building new platforms and making higher quality samples, a diverse plethora of FQH states have been unveiled in experiments.

In addition to many FQH states that have already been identified in previous works, new longitudinal resistance dips are observed at filling factors 17/33 and 15/31. The application of an in-plane magnetic field causes disparate variations of the FQH states. Theoretical foundation of these states is discussed in the framework of composite fermion theory. While most fractions can be explained as non-interacting composite fermions forming integer quantum Hall states, a few states correspond to FQH states of composite fermions that arise from residual interaction between them. We summarize the observed fractions in the range of 0 &lt; $\\nu $ &lt; 2 and propose a pattern to account for their experimental appearance that provides an intuitive picture about the relative strengths of different FQH states.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Supported metal clusters maximize atom efficiency and expose diverse low-coordination metal motifs, but under reaction conditions, they are inherently fluxional—adsorbed reactants can constantly reform and even break the underlying metal–metal and metal–support bonds, generating an ensemble of metastable structures for catalysis. Identification of the interplay between supported clusters and surface chemistries is vital but a challenge for their complex dynamic evolutions. Here, we uncover three characteristic and universal regimes: (i) a fluxional regime, where fast restructuring erases site individuality; (ii) a kinetically trapped regime, where slow restructuring freezes the catalyst into a single geometry; and (iii) a unique coupled regime, where structural dynamics and chemistry occur on comparable timescales and where multiple metastable motifs actively participate in turnover. Moreover, we identify a single, dimensionless metric, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">N</span><sub>c</sub>  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">= τ</span><sub>struct</sub><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">/τ</span><sub>chem</sub>, the ratio between the structural rearrangement timescale (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">τ</span><sub>struct</sub>) and the chemical residence time of the reactant (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">τ</span><sub>chem</sub>), to differentiate these three regimes with distinct activity and stability. It is found that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">N</span><sub>c</sub> should be neither too small (fluxional regime) nor too large (kinetically trapped regime). When the optimal value <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">N</span><sub>c</sub> ≈ 1 is approached (coupled regime), structural and chemical ‘clocks’ match, enabling the multiple active metastable isomers to persist long enough to participate in turnover and maximize reaction rates. Using CO adsorption–desorption on size-selected Cu<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">n</span>​/TiO<sub>2</sub>(110) clusters as a model system, we demonstrate a master kinetic curve versus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">N</span><sub>c</sub> and reveal tunable levers that drive clusters into the optimal coupled regime. Trends generalize across metals: coinage clusters (Ag, Au) bias fluxionality, Rh/Pd favor trapping, and Cu and Pt/Ru often lie near the coupled boundary. Time-scale matching thus emerges as a design rule for adaptive, fluxional catalysts with high activity and stability at the same time.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The Carboniferous to Jurassic units of the Taimyr Peninsula, located at the northern edge of the Siberian Craton in the Russian High Arctic, are integral to the geological history of Pangea and closely linked to the Siberian Traps large igneous province event. This study endeavors to clarify the sedimentary provenance and tectonic evolution of southern Taimyr during the Carboniferous−Jurassic by employing Hf isotope analysis on U-Pb dated detrital zircons. Our results demonstrate that the southwestern Yenisey Ridge and Altai-Sayan Fold Belt were the primary sources of sediment during the Early Permian. Specifically for the Early Permian Byrrangskaya Formation, Late Devonian−Permian zircon grains exhibit negative ε<sub>Hf</sub>(t) values (median of −8.1). From the Late Permian onward, the sediment supply appears to have shifted to northern Taimyr and/or the Polar Urals, with an additional component from the Siberian Traps introduced in the Middle Triassic. Additionally, a ca. 195 Ma zircon with a pronounced negative ε<sub>Hf</sub>(t) value indicates a potential input from the distant Mongol-Okhotsk Belt in the south or the Verkhoyansk fold belt in the east, suggesting an intricate interplay of regional and distant tectonic forces shaped the southern Taimyr’s sedimentary record. The sedimentary and magmatic records of Taimyr provide valuable insights into the complex interplay between regional tectonics and global processes during the final stages of Pangea’s assembly, its breakup, and the subsequent shifts in Earth’s environmental conditions.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Hillslope and river channel processes combine to erode topography and release sediments in response to external forcing, such as tectonics. Any forcing that drives these processes to shape topography likely also controls the resulting sediment characteristics; however, the extent to which the forcing translates into exported sediment grain size remains elusive, especially where tectonic and lithological forcings coexist. Here, we focus on two catchments with these characteristics in the Gulf of Corinth, Greece, to probe how tectonics and lithology compete to control exported sediment grain size via hillslope and channel processes. Topographic analysis reveals that both tectonic and lithological forcings can drive hillslope and channel processes to shape topography. In the Sithas catchment, normal faulting older than 600 ka initiates knickpoints that steepen hillslopes and trigger concentrated mass-wasting downstream of the knickpoints. In the Phoenix catchment, which was only perturbed by active faulting for &lt;100 k.y., the landslide-prone bedrock triggers pervasive mass-wasting and steepens hillslopes. Combined with the observation that mass-wasting produces coarser grains, our data therefore show that both tectonic and lithological forcings can coarsen sediment generated on hillslopes. If hillslope sediment is friable, however, coarsened sediment from hillslopes can be rapidly abraded upon entering river channels and lose its coarse signal before reaching catchment outlets (e.g., tectonically induced coarsening in the Sithas catchment). In contrast, coarsened sediment from hillslopes can preserve its coarse signal to catchment outlets if its lithology is resistant to abrasion (e.g., lithologically induced coarsening in the Phoenix catchment). En route to catchment outlets, sediments coarser than the threshold for entrainment are filtered out; however, this selective transport attenuates rather than obliterates the coarse signal because coarse sediment input itself can increase the entrainment threshold by influencing channel steepness. Finally, we explore how continuous unroofing and knickpoint propagation may cause grain size variations in exported sediments and impact hanging-wall stratigraphy. Consequently, our study illustrates that lithology can outweigh tectonics in determining the characteristics of sediment exported from footwall catchments and paves the way for more comprehensive stratigraphic interpretation.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The relative influence of tectonics and climate on topography and surface processes remains poorly constrained in many mountainous regions. The effect of late-Cenozoic glaciations on global erosion rates and relief is particularly disputed. The Terskey Range, in the Kyrgyz Tian Shan, can provide key insights to these questions due to its well-documented late-Cenozoic tectonic activity and substantial Quaternary glacier cover. To address these questions, we investigated two valleys within the Terskey Range, separated by 40 km: the glacial Barskoon Valley and the mostly fluvial Kyzyl Suu Valley. We present new apatite (U-Th-Sm)/He (AHe) thermochronology data from valley-bottom samples in the Barskoon Valley and re-analyzed published low-temperature thermochronology data for both valleys. Inverse 3-D thermal-kinematic modeling indicates a shared tectonic history for both valleys, including accelerated thrusting starting at 10−8 Ma. In contrast to the Kyzyl Suu Valley, the Barskoon Valley additionally records a 22% increase in relief over the past ∼2 m.y., suggesting rapid valley deepening following the initiation of glaciation in the Terskey Range. These results imply that the impact of Quaternary climate change on erosion rates is highly spatially variable.</span>",

Predictions of transport rates have significantly advanced in recent years, but none of the theoretical models has managed to provide accurate predictions of aeolian transport over a wide range of wind conditions. Here, we develop a theory, based on the physics of different transport regimes, that accounts for the linear and nonlinear scaling exhibited by aeolian sand transport, capturing quantitatively the contribution of these regimes to the total transport for a wide range of wind velocities. Our theoretical predictions are in very good agreement with experimental results for a large range of wind strengths.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Magmatic volatile phases (MVPs) are multicomponent fluids that are a transport medium for metals being transferred from deep magmatic sources to sites of ore formation. However, the melt-to-fluid exchange of metals remains elusive because existing empirical simulations primarily address metal transport through the fate of one chemical element. We use a comprehensive thermochemical model to simulate the fractional crystallization of a silicate melt that degasses a multicomponent MVP. We show that the major and trace element abundances in MVPs formed from non-enriched magmatic systems are indistinguishable from MVPs found as fluid inclusions in mineralized and non-mineralized systems. We therefore conclude that ore formation is the consequence of repetitive intrusion-fractionation-degassing cycles common to crustal systems without pre-enriched sources, as opposed to scenarios wherein a particular or complex chemical system is required. Instead, the driving force of ore formation is a long-lived system fueled by an H<sub>2</sub>O- and Cl-bearing melt. Variations in metal signatures of fluids therefore reflect the pressure-temperature path of melt ascent and the changes in major element composition of the melt.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Typhoon-induced heavy rainfall profoundly affects coastal society and economies, yet predicting its future remains challenging. Historical typhoon records are crucial for deciphering the mechanisms behind typhoon variability, but they seldom span the entire Holocene Epoch. Given the distinctively negative isotopic signatures of typhoon precipitation, this study examined a Holocene precipitation isotope record derived from the hydrogen isotope composition (δD) of leaf-wax <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">n</span>-alkanes in a lake sediment core from the South China coast to assess its potential for reflecting past typhoon activity. The reconstructed precipitation δD (δD<sub>p</sub>) values were less negative during 9.2−3.5 ka (1 ka = 1000 calendar yr B.P.) and more negative during 11.2−9.2 ka and 3.5−0 ka, showing an oscillating “negative-positive-negative” pattern. Superimposed on this pattern were millennial-scale negative excursions coinciding with North Atlantic Bond events. Unlike typical East Asian monsoon stalagmite δ<sup>18</sup>O records, we demonstrate that our δD<sub>p</sub> record reflects regional typhoon activity at millennial and multi-millennial time scales. It is likely that a weaker Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and larger El Niño amplitude synergistically resulted in stronger typhoon activity and thus more negative δD<sub>p</sub> values in coastal South China during the early and late Holocene, respectively, as well as during Bond events.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The histories of submarine explosive volcanoes are commonly poorly known due to inaccessibility of their eruptive archives. This raises uncertainties in the eruption frequencies of these highly hazardous systems, and in their interactions with neighboring volcanoes. The submarine Kolumbo Volcanic Chain (KVC) northeast of Santorini is made up of the polygenetic Kolumbo Volcano and a linear zone of more than 20 smaller volcanic cones and is one of the most active eruptive centers on the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. However, despite the destructive eruption of Kolumbo in 1650 CE, and unrest in 2024−2025, the eruptive history of the KVC is poorly known. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 398 deep-drilled the seafloor at two sites on the western flank of Kolumbo. Here, we use tephrostratigraphy to identify 19 explosive eruptions of the KVC (probably mostly Kolumbo itself) ranging from basaltic andesite to rhyolite in composition and beginning at ca. 265 ka. The lifespan-averaged recurrence time of explosive activity along the KVC is ∼6 k.y. (but as low as ∼1 k.y. between 178 ka and 164 ka), although many of these eruptions were smaller than that of 1650 CE. The birth of Kolumbo coincided with the transition of Santorini to highly explosive activity, possibly due to joint interactions with regional lithospheric stresses. Moreover, the three main phases of edifice construction at Kolumbo (ca. 265−193 ka, 24 ka, and 0.4 ka) broadly correspond to periods of caldera-forming eruptions at Santorini, reflecting additional couplings between the two volcanic systems on shorter time scales.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The mafic intrusions represent one of the key factors contributing to an improved understanding of the characteristics of the Tarim large igneous province (LIP) of northwestern China and the geodynamic processes. The Awati-Manjar transition zone in the northern Tarim Basin contains extensive mafic intrusions, predominantly composed of diabases, making it a critical region for strengthening our understanding of the evolution and dynamics of the Tarim LIP. In this paper, we conducted an integrated analysis of the newly identified diabase intrusions in the Awati-Manjar transition zone of the northern Tarim Basin, including seismic and drilling data interpretation, petrographic observations, U-Pb isotopic dating, and whole-rock elemental and Sr-Nd isotopic analyses. Seismic and drilling data reveal two distinct occurrence models for the diabase intrusions: sill-shaped and saucer-shaped. Apatite U-Pb dating indicates that the diabases range in age from ca. 308 Ma to 266 Ma, with two distinguishable emplacement episodes identified within analytical uncertainty of 308−299 Ma and 286−266 Ma. The diabases from the earlier episode are sparsely distributed across the study area, whereas those from the later episode are widespread and constitute the majority of the diabase intrusions in the region. Geochemically, the diabases belong to an alkaline, sodium-rich, and high-Ti series. They exhibit consistent chondrite-normalized rare earth element and primitive mantle−normalized trace element patterns, marked by pronounced enrichment in light rare earth elements and highly incompatible elements, respectively. Notably, no Eu anomaly is observed, while distinct positive anomalies are present at Ba and Pb. Whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic analyses reveal relatively depleted signatures, with (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr)<sub>i</sub> ratios ranging from 0.7049 to 0.7074 and ε<sub>Nd</sub>(t) values from +0.60 to +2.75. Both elemental and isotopic data indicate that the diabases are compositionally analogous to oceanic-island basalt, implying a genetic link to a mantle plume. That is, they were likely formed through partial melting of a mantle plume source, followed by variable degrees of crustal assimilation and fractional crystallization. More significantly, our newly acquired geological data reveal that the mafic intrusions within the Tarim LIP actually exhibit a longer emplacement duration (spanning the entire lifespan of the Tarim LIP) and a broader spatial distribution (extending beyond the craton margins into its interior) than previously considered. To account for these observed characteristics, a new integrated crust-mantle interaction model has been developed.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The Falkland Islands, within the South Atlantic Ocean, display expansive Paleozoic sedimentary successions for which affinities with coeval depositional systems in southern Gondwana have been debated. New U-Pb zircon age spectra for ash and sandstone samples from the Falklands successions assist in elucidating relationships. Dating of ash samples shows the Port Sussex Formation (Falklands Islands) is younger than the lower Ecca Group of the Karoo Basin, not contemporaneous, as previously proposed. The Falklands and South African Paleozoic sequences differ only modestly, suggesting their accumulation and subsequent inversions were similar, but they represent discrete, basinal entities. Detrital zircon age spectra for samples from the Falklands successions show remarkable age-related comparability. Those from Silurian−earliest Permian samples are dominated by late Neoproterozoic to Cambrian (650−490 Ma) and mid-Mesoproterzoic−earliest Neoproterzoic (1235−940 Ma) age clusters. Populations from younger, post-glacial, Permian strata are dominated by arc-derived Permian clusters, consistent with the occurrence of ashfall horizons in the Port Sussex Formation, as well as subordinate older zircon grains matching the populations from the older successions. Age spectra from the Falkland successions match those of rock assemblages of the Terra Australis Orogen, which developed across southern Gondwana during the late Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic, indicating enduring, large scale, provenance linkages. Two overlapping Paleozoic superbasinal systems, distributed as linear belts extending for &gt;6000 km are recognized as parts of southern Gondwana, stratigraphically separated by a disconformity embracing much of the Carboniferous. A remarkably similar upper-plate subsidence response to subduction along this margin is evident from the Silurian to Permian.</span>",

Modulating age-related metabolic dysregulation offers a promising therapeutic avenue. However, the efficacy of oral therapies is severely hampered by the degradation of active agents in the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Here, we report an orally administrable hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF)-based nanoreactor (MAO@NADH@PB@O-HOF@PEG) designed to intervene in senescence by modulating metabolic pathways. The HOF scaffold exhibits exceptional stability in ultra-acidic conditions and boiling water, providing a robust shield for its encapsulated delicate cargo from GI degradation. This protection enables prolonged <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in situ</span> catalysis within the intestine, leading to reprogramming the gut metabolism by a catalytic degradation of the aging-elevated metabolite isoamylamine (IAA) in the intestine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The apoptosis and inflammation driven by elevated IAA levels are mitigated through the catalytic degradation of IAA by the HOF-based anti-aging nanoreactor. Oral administration of MAO@NADH@PB@O-HOF@PEG to aged mice significantly alleviated cognitive decline, neuronal damage, and neuroinflammation. This study highlights the potential of robust HOF materials in the development of advanced oral delivery systems and geroprotective therapeutics.</span>",

However, challenges such as double remanent polarization (2<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span><sub>r</sub>) degradation and high thermal budget have hindered their integration at advanced technology nodes. Here, we developed an <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">in-situ</span> lanthanum doping strategy in ferroelectric capacitors to address these issues. By controlling the atomic layer deposition pulses of La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub> and ZrO<sub>2</sub>, the lanthanum-doped HZO (La: HZO) film with different lanthanum concentrations were prepared. An ultra-low thermal budget below 300°C was demonstrated in the 0.44% La: HZO film, while it maintained a pronounced 2<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span><sub>r</sub> of 27.8<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> μ</span>C/cm<sup>2</sup>. First-principles calculations suggest that lanthanum incorporation promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is believed to stabilize the orthorhombic phase and activate ferroelectricity in the La: HZO films. Furthermore, the back-end-of-line compatible capacitor with La: HZO also exhibits a low operating voltage of 2.0 V, excellent ferroelectricity with 2<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">P</span><sub>r</sub> of 37.5<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> μ</span>C/cm<sup>2</sup>, rapid switching speed of 446 ns, record-high breakdown voltage of 5.73 V, superior endurance properties over 10<sup>11</sup> cycles and substantial retention.

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Ion migration plays a critical role in the operational stability and efficiency of hybrid perovskite solar cells, yet direct and species-specific quantification of mobile cations remains challenging. Here, we employ infrared photo-induced force microscopy (IR-PiFM) to investigate the migration dynamics of MA<sup>+</sup> and FA<sup>+</sup> in MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, and FA<sub>0.5</sub>MA<sub>0.5</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>. These techniques allow nanoscale mapping and real-time tracking of individual cations with high chemical specificity and 250 μs temporal resolution. Our results reveal composition- and location-dependent ion transport behavior: while MA<sup>+</sup> exhibits higher mobility in pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, its diffusion is significantly suppressed in the mixed-cation system. Surprisingly, FA<sup>+</sup> and MA<sup>+</sup> in FA<sub>0.5</sub>MA<sub>0.5</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> exhibit similar migration rates, suggesting a cooperative migration mechanism. Density functional theory calculations support this interpretation, showing that A-site mixing alters lattice symmetry and raises migration barriers through steric and electrostatic interactions. Bias-dependent nano-IR imaging and open-circuit voltage measurements further show that mixed-cation perovskites confine cation motion and suppress bulk migration, leading to stabilized internal fields and improved voltage performance. These results provide direct evidence for cooperative cation migration dynamics in mixed A-cation perovskites and demonstrate that controlled cation mobility, rather than complete immobilization, may be key to achieving both efficiency and operational durability in perovskite optoelectronics.</span>",

    "summary": "<div>Vertical land motion (VLM) is an underrecognized hazard in susceptible coastal cities, especially those experiencing rapid urbanization. Human-induced VLM often causes elevation loss (subsidence) at rates that exceed, sometimes by an order of magnitude or more, those of climate-driven sea-level rise. Local land subsidence (LLS) also damages infrastructure, disrupts drainage, and alters flood dynamics, yet its broader impacts remain poorly quantified and systematically assessed. This review synthesizes the scientific, technical, and policy dimensions of VLM, with particular focus on LLS, highlighting how natural processes and human activities interact to amplify coastal hazards. We examine the geophysical drivers of VLM, advances in monitoring and modeling, and their integration into hazard assessment frameworks. We consider socioeconomic and infrastructural vulnerabilities of city residents, especially where limited observational capacity and governance gaps intensify risk. VLM acts as both a physical amplifier and a socio-institutional blind spot within coastal adaptation planning, requiring real-time data integration, scenario testing, and inclusive policy development. Finally, we identify key research frontiers&#8212;including subsidence mitigation strategies, dynamic VLM projections, and equitable, high-resolution risk assessment&#8212;to support more resilient, adaptive, and just coastal futures.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Tectonics, sediment compaction, groundwater extraction, and urban loading combine to produce complex, nonlinear patterns of vertical land motion that shape local hazard dynamics.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Local land subsidence, often exceeding the rate of global sea-level rise, is the dominant and least understood driver of coastal flooding and infrastructure risk in many urban regions worldwide.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Subsidence disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating social inequities, driving displacement, and eroding cultural heritage, underscoring the need for inclusive, justice-centered adaptation frameworks.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Closing critical data and policy gaps through coordinated vertical land motion observation, open-access standards, and equitable governance is essential to safeguard coastal populations and sustain long-term urban resilience.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Eclogites are generally divided into two types, xenolithic (mantle) and orogenic (crustal). Xenolithic eclogites are late Archean (ca. 3.0−2.5 Ga) or Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2.1−1.7 Ga) in age and are widely interpreted to have been entrained in younger carbonated magmas as they rose through the lithospheric mantle roots of cratons. By contrast, all reliably dated orogenic eclogites are post-Archean, occurring in three periods ca. 2.2−1.7 Ga, 1.2−0.85 Ga, and &lt;0.7 Ga and are generally found in sutures or accretionary complexes. Although the absence of orogenic eclogites from Archean crust may be due to a tectonic mode dominated by plumes, paleomagnetic data from several Archean cratons indicate periods of lithospheric mobility interspersed with periods of stasis, demonstrating differential motions that require active tectonic boundaries between them. The apparent contradiction between a dominantly plume origin for cratonic crust and periods of lithospheric mobility can be reconciled if tectonic units were larger than the preserved cratonic nuclei in a tectonic mode with episodic subduction. The presence of xenolithic eclogites in the mantle roots of cratons suggests that moderate late-stage thickening was driven by convergence during a transition to global plate tectonics. By contrast, the earliest orogenic eclogites occur in sutures between cratons that form the composite continental fragments familiar to the supercontinent cycle.</span>",

We investigate the 1978 Ardoukoba fissural eruption in the Asal Rift, a syn-rift volcanism archetypal example and the most recent eruption in this segment of the Afar Rift system. Using a comprehensive dataset of melt inclusion and host mineral compositions, volatile contents (H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, δD), and thermobarometry, we reconstruct the transcrustal plumbing system and track magma storage, transfer, and degassing during the eruption. Our results reveal polybaric magma recharge events destabilizing the system, triggering progressive tapping of increasingly deeper mush zones. The eruption began with shallow, evolved melts and transitioned to deeper, more primitive melts and crystal cargos. These findings offer a high-resolution view of magma dynamics during rifting and provide key constraints on the magmatic architecture of incipient oceanic spreading centers.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Ocean Drilling Program Site 1256 was drilled in the Guatemala Basin, eastern Pacific Ocean, sampling superfast-spreading crust. It is one of the deepest drill holes sampling intact oceanic crust and the only site that has penetrated gabbroic rocks away from a tectonic window. Two gabbroic units were sampled at 1157 m and 1283 m below the basement. We collected seismic refraction and wide-angle reflection data across the drill site, and the resulting tomography models show that the first encountered gabbro does not mark the top of the seismic boundary between the upper (layer 2) and the lower (layer 3) crust, which we observe 500−600 m deeper. We propose that the drilled gabbroic rocks may represent either shallow intrusions or depth variations of the magma lens, marking the upper limit of a layer 2−layer 3 transition zone. Seismic tomography and wide-angle migration of mantle reflections reveal rather thin crust of 5 ± 0.2 km (i.e., ∼1.5 s two-way traveltime), being 1 km thinner than normal oceanic crust. The crustal deficit occurs solely within the lower crust. The observed thin crust distinctly differs from typical fast-spreading crust and may indicate the occurrence of a depleted mantle source. Yet, our preferred interpretation is that at superfast spreading rates of &gt;200 mm/yr, the melt transport through the mantle is too slow to provide enough melts to form 6 km of oceanic crust.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The processes governing Li-enrichment of pegmatite magmas to reach spodumene saturation are debated, but recent models advocate that this is achieved by the progressive reworking of Li-rich metasedimentary rocks over several orogenic events. The Proterozoic Aileron Province of the North Australian Craton provides an opportunity to evaluate such models as it is a polydeformed terrane hosting mineralized lithium-cesium-tantalum (LCT) pegmatites. Apatite and cassiterite U-Pb magmatic crystallization ages from the Anningie Pegmatite Field define three distinct stages of pegmatite formation at 1790 Ma, 1750−1740 Ma, and 1725 Ma. These punctuated episodes of pegmatite formation align with three known tectonic events in the North Australian Craton, with supporting geochemical and isotopic data demonstrating that lithium enrichment is driven by the reworking of a Li-rich crustal protolith over multiple orogenic cycles. The Anningie Pegmatite Field represents a real-world example of multi-stage melting processes required to drive lithium enrichment in pegmatite magmas. These results afford a new window into the petrogenesis of LCT pegmatites, allowing for better geodynamic characterization and identification of more robust exploration pathfinders in Proterozoic and Phanerozoic terranes.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The late Cambrian Steptoean positive carbon isotope excursion (SPICE) coincided with the end-Marjuman trilobite extinction and an episode of global ocean euxinia. However, the mechanism that sustained euxinia for ∼2−3 m.y. remains unclear. To address this, a novel combination of carbonate-associated phosphorus (CAP) and iodine [I/(Ca + Mg)] ratios was analyzed at four sites representing a range of water depths across the central Missouri intrashelf basin. Our data demonstrate that CAP rose during the SPICE, in parallel with elevated δ<sup>13</sup>C values and expanded euxinia, indicating increased phosphate availability in the surface ocean. In contrast, I/(Ca + Mg) ratios remained low, demonstrating persistent oxygen-poor conditions in shallow seas. These characteristics can be linked to enhanced phosphorus release and recycling in the ocean due to expanded seafloor euxinia. Based on a coupled oceanic carbon-phosphorus model, we infer that elevated phosphorus levels boosted primary productivity in the surface ocean, leading to increased oxygen generation and enhanced particulate export, sustaining oceanic euxinia until the feedback was broken by rising atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> levels. Our study highlights phosphorus recycling as a key driver of late Cambrian ocean redox instability.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Ore formation throughout Earth’s history has tracked major pulses of crustal growth. The spectacular endowment of some greenstone belts, in particular, has been linked to high heat flow and extensive Archean rifting. Three aspects were likely important: (1) greater numbers of plates required to dissipate the heat; (2) abundant crustal-scale transcurrent faults to accommodate plate growth; and (3) increased hydrothermal convection to cool the crust at the plate boundaries. Because the plates were smaller and more numerous than today, the total ridge length was greater, thus allowing for more efficient cooling of the newly formed crust. Mantle upwelling and rifting between microplate domains focused melts and fluids into well-mineralized corridors. This tectonic style is observed today at the Indo-Australian margin, providing clues to the crustal architecture of some well-endowed Archean terranes, such as the Abitibi greenstone belt in the Superior province of Canada.Hot, thickened oceanic crust, like that of the modern Lau basin and North Fiji basin, has strong similarities to mineral-rich greenstone belts like the Abitibi in terms of structure, kinematics, and magmatic evolution. The majority of this crust formed during a basin-wide microplate “breakout” that occurred in response to the collision of Australia with the Ontong Java and Melanesian Border plateaus in the Late Miocene. Today, the back-arc basins contain some of the fastest growing crust on Earth and an extraordinary concentration of magmatic and hydrothermal activity. In the northern Lau basin, at least seven distinct microplates formed within the last 5 m.y., with crustal growth partitioned across numerous simultaneously active plate boundaries in a complex microplate mosaic. The plates are bound by active spreading centers, ridges, and shear zones that are continuously deforming in response to plate rotation. Basin opening is dominated by many short, slow-spreading segments between large-scale transcurrent fault zones, with a combined strike length of spreading centers greater than in any other back-arc basin in the western Pacific. Seismic sections to depths of at least 20 km show that the plate boundaries are broad zones of deformation characterized by overlapping spreading centers, ridge jumps, and extensional transforms. Increased crustal permeability occurs where multiple spreading centers intersect (i.e., at triple junctions) with enhanced magmatic and hydrothermal activity at the plate boundaries. Seismic velocities and volcanic geochemistry also show large variations in crustal composition between the plates, indicating that the back-arc region is far more complex than supposed in earlier models.We suggest crustal growth and mineral endowment in some greenstone belts were similarly regulated by microplate formation. Because the microplates behave independently, often at great distances from the nearest subduction zone, their formation is akin to autochthonous growth in the Archean when subduction-zone processes were either absent or in their infancy. Compelling evidence of this architecture is now being revealed in the Abitibi greenstone belt by modeling of the Archean Moho topography.</span>",

The deposit is defined by three key zones of mineralization that are located adjacent to an interpreted upper crustal fault (known as the Lithoprobe fault): (1) quartz veining in mafic volcanic rocks in the hinge zone; (2) quartz veining in sulfide-rich argillite horizons in the limb zone; and (3) disseminated and vein-hosted gold within a high-strain zone in the hanging wall of the Lithoprobe fault. The stratigraphy in the hanging wall of the Lithoprobe fault, known colloquially as the Felsic domain, consists of sedimentary rocks (MS1, MS2, and MS3), felsic volcaniclastic rocks (F1), and felsic porphyries (E31 and E32), which were metamorphosed to lower amphibolite facies conditions. We interpret the felsic porphyries, which host a significant fraction of the established gold mineralization, as synsedimentary, emplaced as subvolcanic intrusions and lava domes within an interpreted structural basin. Uranium-lead dating by chemical abrasion-isotope dilution-thermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) of magmatic zircons from the synsedimentary quartz-feldspar (QF) porphyry (E31) constrains the age of magmatism to 2710.2 ± 1.2 Ma, which is inconsistent with existing interpretations of the stratigraphy as part of the 2748 to 2742 Ma McNeely sequence of the Confederation assemblage. The E31 porphyry is instead temporally equivalent with a suite of younger syntectonic porphyries and tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite intrusions in the Red Lake gold camp. This age also constrains the maximum age of mineralization to &lt;2710 Ma, which is younger than other established gold deposits in the Red Lake greenstone belt, including the giant 2723 to 2712 Ma Campbell-Red Lake deposit, suggesting a second major mineralization event succeeded regional D<sub>2</sub> shortening and mineralization in the Red Lake greenstone belt. High-strain zones and structural basins associated with major faults, somewhat akin to the fault-related orogenic gold deposits of the Abitibi subprovince, may therefore represent important first-order targets for exploration in the Red Lake greenstone belt and the adjacent greenstone belts of the Uchi subprovince.</span>",

The recognition of such patterns can help to fingerprint fluid flow paths and provide valuable vectors for near-mine exploration. The Nayongzhi deposit (30.1 million tonnes [Mt] at 6.57<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">%</span> Zn and 0.91<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">%</span> Pb) exhibits clear lateral and vertical zonation patterns in ore types and metal ratios, making it an ideal case study to explore the behavior of other geochemical zonation markers. In this contribution, we report zonation patterns observed in both carbonate C-O isotope compositions and the trace element chemistry of sphalerite. Ore-related dolomite shows systematically higher δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>V-PDB</sub> (Vienna-Pee Dee Belemnite) and δ<sup>18</sup>O<sub>V-SMOW</sub> (Vienna-standard mean ocean water) values with increasing distance to the feeder structure, probably reflecting a decrease in the fluid-rock ratios. In addition, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of sphalerite revealed systematic spatial and temporal variations in trace element contents. The contents of Mn, Fe, Cu, Ga, Ge, and In decrease with distance from the feeder fault, whereas the contents of Cd increase. Manganese, Fe, Ge, and Tl are also concentrated in early sphalerite, whereas Ga and Cd are more abundant in later sphalerite. Such variations appear to be predominantly governed by changes in physicochemical parameters, such as temperature, fS2, and fluid composition. Finally, multivariate regression analysis identified three footprint elements in sphalerite—Mn, Ga, and In—whose combined compositional variations are particularly informative concerning the relative distances of samples to the feeder fault. The application of the resultant sphalerite proximitor to another structurally controlled MVT deposit effectively traced fluid flow paths and identified the relative distances of samples to the fluid influx center. Consequently, our study highlights the potential of sphalerite trace element chemistry, together with C-O isotopes, to serve as a novel exploration tool in MVT deposits. However, our results also demonstrate that the accurate petrologic identification of paragenetic mineral generations will generally be essential for reliably vectoring toward fluid influx centers.</span>",

Although extensively studied, the timescales over which sufficient volumes of mineralizing fluids are extracted from magma source regions and focused into narrow, shallow zones of mineralization remain poorly understood. Here, we provide constraints on the onset and duration of porphyry-style mineralization from detailed field, mineralogical, geochemical and geochronological studies of the classic Yerington porphyry district of Nevada, where Cenozoic extension and tilting has exposed an exceptional ~8-km top-to-bottom cross section through the porphyry system. From high-precision zircon U-Pb dating, the exposed Luhr Hill granite cupola of the Yerington batholith, and multiple generations of aplitic- and porphyry dikes, on which the porphyry-type deposits are centered, were emplaced within only ~100 k.y. Cu mineralization of miarolitic cavities and unidirectional solidification textures within the dikes, and in associated quartz veins, was late in the transition from magmatic to hydrothermal conditions, only occurring once fluids cooled below ~600°C. From Re-Os age determinations for vein molybdenite in the Bear and Ann Mason deposits, mineralization was coeval with, and much longer lived (&gt;1 m.y.) than pluton and dike emplacement. We propose that magmatic-hydrothermal fluids exsolving early and deep (at porphyry-forming depths) were initially too hot to precipitate ore minerals. However, as these fluids ascended and cooled, mineralization could occur at shallower (epithermal) levels. At the depth of porphyry deposit formation, it was only as magmatism waned that the fluids could cool adequately to precipitate hypogene ore minerals. We suggest that future studies integrate microtextural studies with multifaceted geochronology to further characterize and model these processes in porphyry and similar types of magmatic-hydrothermal systems.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Anatolia hosts different types of volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits in the Eastern Pontides, Bitlis-Zagros suture zone, and Central Pontides. The recently discovered giant Karaburun deposit (~125 million tonnes [Mt] grading 1.16 wt % Cu, 0.25 wt % Zn, and 0.05 wt % Co) of the Central Pontides is the largest VMS deposit in Turkey. The mineralization is hosted within the greenschist metamorphosed rocks of the Çangaldağ Metamorphic Complex. Mineralization is associated with metamorphosed volcaniclastic, clastic detrital sedimentary, and deep marine sedimentary rocks, as well as crosscutting submarine mafic dikes and/or sills. The deposit mainly occurs as a stratiform Cu-Zn ± Co sheet-like and tabular body that contains disseminated, banded, pyritic clastic, semimassive, and massive sulfide textures. The primary ore minerals are pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, magnetite, and trace galena. Supergene covellite, bornite, chalcocite, and digenite are observed. Surface weathering and oxidation resulted in hematite, goethite, lepidocrocite, malachite, and water-soluble copper minerals. Mineralization-stage pyrites yield an age of 163.6 ± 7.1 Ma (Re-Os; Late Jurassic; lowermost Oxfordian), which is consistent with the ages of different components in the same rifting system. The δ<sup>34</sup>S values of pyrites range from 3.07 to 5.10‰, suggesting a mixed origin between basalts and thermochemically reduced seawater sulfate. Late Cretaceous metamorphism caused brittle and ductile deformation within the sulfide phases, promoting the remobilization of metal-bearing minerals. Subsequent deformation phases likely led to the dismemberment and juxtaposition of mineralized levels. Together, the data indicate that Karaburun is a pelitic-mafic replacement-type VMS deposit that formed in a back-arc basin environment of the Jurassic ensimatic arc-back arc-rift system.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Orogenic gold deposits commonly host high-grade gold lodes that are rich in visible gold associated with pyrite. The origin of abundant visible gold in pyrite, however, remains unclear. This study uses a novel combination of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography to reveal the micro- to atomic-scale processes for the formation of visible gold within pyrite from high-grade gold lodes (~3,000 g/t) at the world-class Jinshan orogenic gold deposit, China. These results show that visible gold resulted from multistage processes that include deposition of primary auriferous pyrite, formation of microscopic gold during pyrite replacement, and formation of irregular visible gold. During hydrothermal replacement of pyrite via dissolution and reprecipitation, invisible gold remobilized from primary pyrite formed gold nanoparticles on the replacement interfaces. Aggregation of gold nanoparticles led to the formation of microscopic gold. Interactions between pyrite and another pulse of ore fluid led to the dissolution and remobilization of earlier microscopic gold to produce irregular visible gold surrounding pyrite and within fractures. Mass balance calculations, however, indicate that most of the visible gold was introduced from the ore fluid and not remobilized. This ore fluid preferentially infiltrated into low-stress interfaces between pyrite and chalcopyrite to form Au-rich nanolayers. Dislocation-mediated interfacial diffusion of gold nanolayers contributed to the formation of gold stringers and visible gold. In situ sulfur and iron isotope compositions of pyrite and chalcopyrite indicate that the multiple pulses of ore fluid were mostly derived from the greenschist facies metamorphosed wall rocks. Our results provide significant new insights into the roles of different Au-rich nanophases and their subsequent remobilization and reenrichment in the formation of abundant visible gold in high-grade orogenic gold systems worldwide.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Partial melting of the juvenile lower crust is thought to contribute to porphyry Cu formation in Tethyan collisional domains, such as Gangdese, Sanjiang, Iran. We used a Monte Carlo-based partial melting model of the eastern Gangdese lower crust based on a refined dataset of Eocene to Miocene whole-rock element and isotope geochemistry to evaluate its control on Cu endowments. Our findings agree with previous studies that multiple factors (magmatic source, oxidation state, water content, volatiles) affect the probability of depositing economic Cu. A key finding of Miocene giant to large porphyry Cu formation is a significant increase in the degree of melting of the lower crust from Eocene to Miocene, as well as a transition of the composition of the lower crustal mineral assemblages from plagioclase-dominated to amphibole- and garnet-dominated assemblages. The modeling delineates clearly the spatial variations in melting degree and mineral proportion of the lower crust source from west to east (longitude 88°–94° E), showing the tonnage of porphyry copper deposits in the eastern Gangdese belt has a positive correlation with melting degree. We suggest that the proximity to slab-tearing zones and the influx of mantle-derived trachytic magmas were instrumental in enhancing the Cu endowments. A large degree of partial melting of the lower crust with continuous amphibole fractional crystallization and mantle input results in high magmatic water content and oxidation, facilitating the mobilization and concentration of Cu within the magma, thereby enhancing the potential for porphyry deposit formation. This research not only enhances our understanding of the intricate petrogenetic mechanisms behind significant mineral deposits but also has considerable implications for future exploration in the collisional orogens.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The depth level at which porphyry Cu–forming magmas fractionated and exsolved mineralizing fluids is actively debated. In the classic model, extensive magma fractionation occurs in large, upper crustal magma chambers, and concomitant fluid exsolution leads to forceful expulsion of residual magmas in the form of porphyry dikes, stocks, and breccia pipes, which subsequently serve as pathways for the mineralizing fluids. In contrast, some recent studies highlighting the role of deep crustal magma fractionation in the production of fertile magmas essentially deny the existence of upper crustal magma chambers at the time of mineralization. To address this, we conducted a detailed thermobarometric investigation of 13 intermediate to felsic, porphyritic intrusive rocks related to porphyry-skarn Cu mineralization at Santa Rita and Hanover-Fierro, New Mexico, United States, representing two premineralization magmas (61–60 Ma), seven synmineralization magmas (60–58 Ma), and four late- to postmineralization magmas (58–57 Ma).For each sample, the pressure of last magma crystallization before final magma ascent to the current exposure level was reconstructed based on Al-in-hornblende barometry of small hornblende inclusions trapped within quartz phenocrysts and through titanium-in-quartz (TitaniQ) thermobarometry of the host quartz phenocrysts themselves. Since quartz is one of the last crystallizing magmatic minerals, and no significant phenocryst growth could have occurred in small dikes and stocks after final magma emplacement, quartz phenocrysts and their contained hornblende inclusions record the depth of last magma crystallization before final magma ascent. When present, hornblende phenocrysts and hornblende inclusions within other major phenocrysts were also analyzed. Both quartz and hornblende barometers return consistent average pressures of 3.2 ± 0.4 kbar for the entire suite of pre- to postmineralization magmas, corresponding to depths of 11 to 14 km. The synmineralization magmas return even more consistent average pressures of 3.1 ± 0.2 kbar, corresponding to a depth of 12 ± 1 km.The volume of the mineralizing porphyry dikes and stocks at the emplacement level is far too small to have provided all the fluids and metals required to form the observed ore deposits. Therefore, the majority of the ore-forming fluids must have originated from the magmas that crystallized at 12 ± 1 km depth. The ore deposits, conversely, formed at ~5-km paleodepth. This implies that most of the mineralizing fluids traveled an average vertical distance of ~7 km from their magmatic source to the eventual site of ore precipitation. The relatively unaltered nature and low veining degree of deeper parts of mineralized porphyry dikes and stocks suggest that the fluid transport through these intrusive bodies occurred mostly at near-solidus conditions by means of fluid percolation along grain boundaries.In summary, our results suggest that (1) a large, upper crustal pluton exists ~7 km beneath the Santa Rita and Hanover-Fierro deposits; (2) abundant phenocryst crystallization occurred at this depth level; and (3) this pluton was the main source for the exsolution of ore-forming fluids. However, the investigated rocks have elevated whole-rock Sr/Y ratios, indicating magma fractionation at deep crustal levels. As a result, our preferred model is a combination of the two end-member models introduced above, with most magma fractionation having occurred in the deep crust and with residual, intermediate to felsic melts having ascended and accumulated at 11 to 14 km paleodepth, where they continued to crystallize with comparatively little crystal-liquid separation, before some of these magmas ascended further to shallow levels and quenched to porphyries.</span>",

This advantage partly arises from the brain’s cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction (PMI) tasks. The model drives sequential evolution of long-range inter-module connections to facilitate positive knowledge transfer, and uses feedback-guided local inhibition/pruning to eliminate prior task redundancies, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments on the proposed cross-domain PMI dataset and general datasets (CIFAR100, ImageNet) show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain’s developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The Ediacaran biota has been informally divided into three ecostratigraphic units: the lowermost deep marine Avalon Assemblage, the overlying shallow-marine White Sea Assemblage, and the uppermost Nama Assemblage. While there are some shared taxa among all three, they have been considered relatively robust, informal, biostratigraphic entities. We document a rich new fossil site that includes most of the Avalon Assemblage biota from the EM Coombs Surface at Inner Meadow, Newfoundland, Canada, and date it to 550.78 ± 0.60 Ma, equivalent to the youngest White Sea Assemblage faunas. This demonstrates that the Avalon and White Sea assemblages are contemporaneous, that the differences between them are ecological, not stratigraphic, and that the Avalon Assemblage biotas were also affected by the 550 Ma Kotlin Crisis that has hitherto been considered to only affect the White Sea Assemblage. The impoverished post-extinction Nama Assemblage succeeds the Kotlin Crisis, which our data reveal to be more profound than previously known. The Kotlin Crisis is considered to be the first significant extinction event experienced by the Eumetazoa, ∼10 m.y. before the Cambrian radiation.</span>",

Through orbital spectral analyses of a long-lived volcanic system south of Pavonis Mons that, over multiple eruptions, transitioned from a fissure vent to a point-source cone-forming vent, we identified mineralogical changes across morphologically distinct units. The fissure-fed lava flows exhibit olivine spectral characteristics, indicating deep-sourced magma, likely from the mantle or lower crust, while younger, finger-shaped lava flows on the cone are dominated by high-calcium pyroxenes, indicating a more evolved magma source. While these two different-aged units originate from the same regional plumbing system, their mineralogical differences suggest magmatic differentiation through crustal storage, possible assimilation, and fractional crystallization during subsequent cooling. These findings enhance our understanding of magma evolution in the late Amazonian on Mars.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Upwelling mantle plumes are recognized to modify the continental lithosphere by building craton-like keels or inducing thermal erosion−related thinning. Such plume-related modification may exert long-term control over subsequent deformation and topographic evolution. In the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), the late Permian Emeishan large igneous province (ELIP), generated by mantle plume activity, significantly modified the lithospheric architecture in this region. However, current geodynamic models of Cenozoic plateau formation largely neglect the impact of ELIP-related lithospheric modification. Here, we investigated spatial variations in Cenozoic deformation and exhumation across the ELIP’s inner and intermediate zones. These zones span from the plume head to its periphery and are cut by two major Cenozoic faults: the Ailaoshan−Red River (ALS-RR) and Xianshuihe (XSH) faults. Our results reveal minimal post-Oligocene exhumation within the inner zone (0.05−0.15 km/m.y.), in contrast to higher rates in the intermediate zone (0.2−0.3 km/m.y.) and along the ALS-RR (0.4−2.5 km/m.y.) and XSH faults (0.4−0.9 km/m.y.). The limited exhumation corresponds to weak deformation within the inner zone. Integrating geological and geophysical data, we suggest that the late Permian plume activity emplaced voluminous mantle-derived mafic-ultramafic intrusions into the crust beneath the ELIP’s inner zone, increasing crustal rigidity and resistance to Cenozoic deformation and exhumation. Our findings highlight how plume-related lithospheric modification may exert a lasting influence on intraplate deformation, persisting hundreds of millions of years after plume cessation.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Determining the formation temperatures of rocks and minerals is essential in understanding geological processes. Recently developed Mg-in-magnetite geothermometer has been used widely to estimate the temperature of magmatic and hydrothermal systems accurately. However, the applicability of this approach to natural samples has yet to be evaluated fully. We collected 4831 LA–ICP–MS magnetite analyses from various ore deposits, including Magmatic, Fe oxide–apatite (IOA), Fe oxide–Cu–Au (IOCG), porphyry, and skarn deposits. Our results suggest that the Mg geothermometer may not be applicable to magnetite in some of these systems. The geothermometer is typically effective in determining mineralization temperatures in magmatic Fe–Ti–V deposits and in high-temperature hydrothermal IOA, IOCG, and porphyry deposits; however, there are discrepancies when they are applied to skarn deposits, where temperatures obtained using the Mg-in-magnetite geothermometer (800–1000 °C) are much higher than corresponding fluid-inclusion homogenization temperatures (200–500 °C). To address this problem, we used a machine learning Random Forest regression model to estimate temperature based on various elements, including Ti, V, Mg, Mn, Co, Si, Al, and Zn contents. We introduce an empirical geothermometer based on the Ti and V contents of magnetite. The temperature estimated by this empirical geothermometer is in good agreement with the homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in hydrothermal magnetite, as well as with the temperature of magmatic magnetite derived from other independent geothermometers. The result demonstrates the robustness and applicability of the new geothermometer in various geological environments.</span>",

Recent investigations of dense oxyhydroxides in the (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">δ</span>-AlOOH)-(MgSiO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>)-(<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ε</span>-FeOOH) system have revealed that these phases may carry hydrogen into the lowermost mantle and contribute to heterogeneity of seismic velocities. To retain hydrogen at the high temperatures of the lower mantle, it is likely that hydrogen bonds must become symmetric, and consequently strong, at high pressure. In this work, we use Raman and infrared spectroscopy to assess the hydrogen bonding environment of (Al,Fe)-phase H (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">δ</span>-Al<sub>0.84</sub>Fe<sup>3+</sup> Mg<sub>0.02</sub>Si<sub>0.06</sub>OOH) and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">δ</span>-Fe13 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">δ</span>-Al<sub>0.87</sub>Fe<sub>0.13</sub>OOH) at high pressure. We conclude that (Al,Fe)-phase H has occupationally disordered hydrogen atoms due to cation substitutions at ambient pressure. Hydrogen bonds in this phase become dynamically disordered at approximately 10 GPa and symmetric at 35 GPa.

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>There is a growing demand for critical metals (e.g., nickel, cobalt and chromium) that are needed for the production and storage of cleaner energy. Historical tailings from ultramafic mines are increasingly being viewed as a source of critical metals, but the distribution and abundance of these metals post-mining tends to be imprecisely known. Here, we examine the distribution and abundance of nickel, cobalt and chromium in weathered tailings from the historical Lord Brassey nickel mine in Tasmania, Australia. We test the utility of three analytical approaches, quantitative X-ray diffraction (QXRD), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), and whole rock elemental analysis, for assessing the grade and recoverability of these metals from tailings. From these analyses, heazlewoodite (Ni<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>) and awaruite (Ni<sub>3</sub>Fe) are the major sources of nickel, cobaltpentlandite (Co<sub>9</sub>S<sub>8</sub>) is the major host of cobalt, and chromite (FeCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) is the major host of chromium. Whole rock elemental compositions were calculated from the integration of QXRD and EPMA data and results show that tailings from Lord Brassey qualify as low-grade nickel and cobalt ore. The similarity of the calculated results with the measured elemental abundance data demonstrate that integrating QXRD and EPMA datasets provides accurate estimates of whole rock geochemistry that are comparable to standard whole rock analyses while providing much-needed context about the complex and evolving mineralogy of critical metals in mine tailings. A better geometallurgical understanding of the mineralogy, and the grade, of tailings offers enticing possibilities for including reprocessing as part of a tailings management strategy.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Natural and synthetic samples belonging to the periclase – wüstite system have been shown to contain nano-crystalline exsolutions of spinel ferrite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-MgFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) solid solution. Understanding this exsolution process requires knowledge of the conditions under which it forms in ferric-iron-bearing periclase – wüstite samples. However, for MgO-rich compositions no direct measurements exist of the Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sub>tot</sub> ratio of Fe-bearing periclase in equilibrium with spinel ferrite, even at 1 atmosphere. Such measurements would provide a valuable constraint for thermodynamic models describing the MgO–FeO–Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system.In this study, Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sub>tot</sub> ratios have been determined for periclase – wüstite samples synthesized from two starting materials, (Mg<sub>0.87</sub>Fe<sub>0.13</sub>)O and (Mg<sub>0.23</sub>Fe<sub>0.77</sub>)O, at 1300 °C in a gas-mixing furnace, at oxygen fugacities up to those where they coexists with macroscopically visible grains of spinel ferrite. A platinum-alloy redox sensor is used to determine the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">f</span>O<sub>2</sub> of each sample. All recovered samples with Fe<sup>3+</sup>/Fe<sub>tot</sub> ratios &gt; 0.07 contain topotaxial exsolutions of nano-crystalline spinel ferrite, with grain sizes that reach ∼100 nm in more Fe-rich samples but decrease to ∼ 5 nm in samples quenched more rapidly into water. The coherent exsolution of spinel ferrite from Fe-bearing periclase induces lattice strain in both phases, resulting in a smaller unit-cell parameter for Fe-bearing periclase and a larger one for spinel ferrite, than otherwise expected. In Mössbauer spectra, the exsolution appears as sextets showing relaxation, with magnetic hyperfine fields that shift towards lower values and then collapse as the grain size decreases.The initial high-temperature ferric iron content in Fe-bearing periclase obtained by combining the contribution from the spinel ferrite exsolution with the amount of Fe<sup>3</sup>⁺ remaining in the (Mg,Fe)O, was used to fit a thermodynamic model describing the periclase - wüstite stability field as a function of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">f</span>O<sub>2</sub> in the MgO–FeO–Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system. The model reproduces the measurements well, although some deviations remain towards high-MgO compositions at lower <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">f</span>O<sub>2</sub>. This highlights the need for more sophisticated models that account for differences in Fe<sup>3</sup>⁺ coordination in (Mg,Fe)O.Microstructures of spinel ferrite exsolutions in Fe-bearing periclase inclusions in natural diamonds are very similar to those observed in this study. The thermodynamic model supports the hypothesis that the exsolution occurs in these (Mg,Fe)O samples as they cool after emplacement near the surface, to temperatures &lt; 1000 °C.</span>",

This review traces the evolution of geoethics through key milestones, such as international organizations and foundational documents, and outlines its core principles.

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">We explore the fate of subducted continental margins using thermomechanical modeling with constant-force boundary conditions. Under certain conditions, large volumes of upper crust can get subducted to mantle depth, detach from the slab, and rise through the upper plate’s lithosphere even against considerable compressive tectonic stress. At the surface, such an event is expressed as a phase of intense horizontal extension and magmatism internal of the oceanic suture zone. The process can create normal-fault-bounded core complexes hundreds of kilometers wide, in which metamorphic continental crust derived from the subducting plate is exposed. Horizontal tectonic stress and the thickness of the downgoing upper crust control the width of complexes, their topographic elevation, and the subduction depth of exposed rocks. We propose that the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex on the Balkan Peninsula represents a prime example for such vertical extrusion internal of a suture zone. Lower tectonic units in this domain exhibit Eocene high-pressure metamorphism and nappe stacking followed by massive magmatism and large-offset normal faulting. Despite more than 100 km of extension in Cenozoic times, the area still has thick crust. Our modeling results support schemes that attribute the lower units of the Rhodope Metamorphic Complex to the subducted Adriatic plate.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Back-arc basin basalts are broadly similar in composition to mid-ocean ridge basalts, but also incorporate arc-like geochemical signatures. The processes governing melt transport from the arc to the back-arc spreading center remain enigmatic, particularly beneath slow-spreading systems with limited melt volumes, where imaging of small-scale structures has been challenging. Here, we use multimode Rayleigh-wave tomography, enhanced by increased raypath coverage through both two- and three-station interferometry, to resolve S-wave velocity structure down to ∼100 km depth beneath the central Mariana subduction zone. Our model reveals a triangle-like low-velocity anomaly at 15−30 km depth beneath the Mariana trough and an elliptical low-velocity anomaly at 50−90 km depth beneath the Mariana arc, both consistent with melt equilibration depths from thermobarometry. Additionally, a cylindrical low-velocity anomaly extends from the base of the triangle-like low-velocity anomaly to ∼80 km depth and appears weakly connected to the anomaly beneath the arc. We interpret this feature as diapiric upwelling that links melt sources beneath the arc and back-arc.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Distributed volcanic fields occur globally, but the processes that control volcanic composition and behavior remain uncertain. To investigate the controls on eruptive style, melt storage, and hazards in a system with voluminous mafic and intermediate and/or silicic lavas, we seismically imaged the subsurface beneath the San Francisco volcanic field in northern Arizona (USA). Results reveal two partial melt zones and regional changes in crustal thickness, related to lower crustal removal. San Francisco Mountain, a felsic stratovolcano, is located atop a boundary between intact and removed crust. This lateral boundary in lithospheric properties concentrates melt into mid- and lower-crustal reservoirs, enabling felsic volcanism in this dominantly basaltic field. This demonstrates how lateral lithospheric gradients focus melt in distributed volcanic fields, with removal playing a key role in creating these gradients.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The origin and association of high-silica granites (HSGs; SiO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 71 wt%) and residual intermediate to felsic cumulates remain enigmatic due to their rare coexistence. These limitations complicate their characterization, parental source, and tectonic setting identification. This work presents a case study from the Mikir Hills, NE India, utilizing zircon U-Pb geochronology, mineral chemistry, and geochemical thermodynamic modeling constraints to understand the origin and relationship of ca. 508 Ma high-K monzogranites, granites, and HSGs. The monzogranites show accumulated plagioclase crystals and high Ba, Sr, and CaO, whereas the HSGs show depleted Ba, Sr, and CaO, representing fractionated melt. The redox calculations (ΔNNO −0.3 to −0.1) and thermometry results (∼880−902 °C) using amphibole chemistry show oxidized and high-temperature conditions for monzogranites. The monzogranites’ high K<sub>2</sub>O and large-ion lithophile elements suggest the role of a sediment-derived enriched mantle source in their origin. The rhyolite-MELTS and Magma Chamber Simulator modeling results suggest the monzogranites’ parental melt resulted from a silicic metasomatized phlogopite-stabilized lithospheric mantle wedge that underwent subsequent lower crust assimilation. The polybaric (∼6−4 kbar) crystallization of the generated assimilated melt formed the monzogranites with plagioclase and K-feldspar as the dominant crystallizing phase (&gt;50%). Plagioclase-melt equilibrium tests yield slightly higher liquid-only saturation temperatures than plagioclase-liquid pairs, indicating progressive crystallization and melt extraction. The rhyolite-MELTS geobarometer suggests the highly felsic melts separated from the crystal mush between ∼3.8 kbar and 2.8 kbar and emplaced at subvolcanic levels as failed rhyolite eruptions. We suggest the HSGs represent extracted evolved melt, while monzogranites represent residual silicic cumulates formed in a syn- to postcollisional setting during Gondwana assembly.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Active environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, typically involving water filtration, offers the advantage of capturing relatively high concentrations of eDNA, making it particularly valuable in aquatic environments with low-DNA concentrations. However, this approach faces several limitations, including low DNA capture efficiency, limited molecular selectivity, and the risk of contamination during filtration and handling. Moreover, commonly used membrane materials often lack strong and specific DNA-binding affinity, which reduces detection sensitivity and compromises biodiversity assessment. To address these challenges, we developed a MoS<sub>2</sub>-coated mixed cellulose ester (MCE) membrane that significantly enhances both the efficiency and selectivity in capturing eDNA. The MoS<sub>2</sub> coating facilitates preferential interactions with DNA via van der Waals forces between sulfur atoms in MoS<sub>2</sub> and the oxygen or nitrogen atoms in DNA bases. Laboratory and field tests with marine fish confirmed that the MoS<sub>2</sub>-coated membrane significantly enhanced the selectivity and sensitivity of eDNA-based biota detection. This work represents the first application of a two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial-based membrane for eDNA collection and detection. Furthermore, the membrane is low-cost, scalable, and requires no further processing. This invention offers a promising strategy for the development of 2D nanomaterials-based eDNA sampling tools and showcases their broader potential in environmental biotechnology applications.</span>",

However, existing methods for design and fabrication of interfaces with human skin still cannot meet the challenging clinical requirements of superior adhesion during monitoring and avoiding wound damage during peel-off. Here, we propose a soft biosensor with universal responsive hydrogel interfaces for detecting blood circulation complications. Particularly, we develop thermoresponsive and printable hydrogel inks to achieve rapidly high-precision patterning and wide-range adhesion regulation of interface layers. In clinical cases, the hydrogel biosensor can establish robust hydrogel/flap skin coupling for high-fidelity signal acquisition during monitoring, and ensure benign detachment to prevent tissue injury after monitoring. We achieve precise arterial perfusion monitoring based on the perfusion index (PI) via an 810 nm light source. Additionally, we propose a new metric, the balance index (BI), to monitor venous congestion. By analyzing BI, PI, and skin temperature, the biosensor enables accurate detection and differentiation of blood circulation complications. The printable thermoresponsive hydrogel can be adopted as a universal interface in flexible electronics for healthcare applications, and the biosensor represents a promising platform for blood circulation monitoring.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming Earth science, offering unprecedented capabilities to tackle the field’s most pressing challenges. This work explores significant advances and emerging challenges across the AI for atmosphere-ocean sciences, while outlining critical ways forward. We review deep learning methods and their application in weather and climate forecasting, which outperforms dynamical models in accuracy and computational efficiency. The role of AI in detecting complex phenomena, enhancing data assimilation and reconstruction, bias correction and downscaling coarse model outputs is also examined. However, the “black box” nature of complex AI models necessitates a focus on explainable AI to build trust and extract mechanistic insight. The most promising path forward is identified as the development of hybrid physics-AI modeling, which integrates the data-driven power of AI with the foundational constraints of physical laws to ensure generalizability and causal consistency. A new framework for AI-based model intercomparison is essential for rigorously benchmark performance. Finally, we contextualize these technical developments by discussing the usefulness and applicability of AI to society, including the improvement of multi-hazard early warning systems and green energy production. We conclude by envisioning the future of AI agents for Earth science—autonomous, goal-oriented systems capable of designing and running experiments, generating and testing hypotheses, and learning dynamics from multi-source data. This synthesis underscores that AI is not merely a tool but a paradigm shift, which will significantly improve how we understand and adapt to a changing climate.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Antarctic water tracks are shallow groundwater flow networks that route summer season meltwater downslope over the ice table. Water track pore fluids are highly concentrated in solutes, including silica, and water track sediments are enriched in sediment fines. However, given the extreme cold and aridity of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, it has not been clear whether aluminosilicate weathering is occurring in Dry Valleys water tracks, or whether high solute concentrations merely reflect evaporative concentration of marine or eolian-derived salts, rather than aluminosilicate weathering. Based on geochemical and isotopic analysis of water track pore fluids and freshwater snow and ice melt samples from the McMurdo Dry Valleys, coupled with flow path modeling and measurements of soil aluminum concentration, we show that silica enrichment in water tracks is not due only to silicic waters being evaporatively concentrated, but, instead, that water track composition is consistent with active and ongoing aluminosilicate weathering of water track soils. We show that water tracks connect the landscape at the hillslope scale, draining areas up to 10<sup>5</sup> m<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>2</sup> each, and concentrating silica and other solutes from across the watershed. We find that water tracks are sites where chemical weathering products like clays and amorphous aluminum−bearing aggregates are being generated in situ, and solute concentrations are consistent with fluids in equilibrium with weathering product mineral phases. This suggests that expansion of water tracks due to regional warming, greater snowmelt, or permafrost thaw could increase the area of exposed soils in which chemical weathering can occur, altering Antarctica’s role in globally relevant soil biogeochemical processes.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Fault-related folds and their associated secondary faults play a critical yet often underrecognized role in accommodating strain and generating earthquakes in active fold-and-thrust belts. In the Seattle fault zone (SFZ), Washington, USA, we present new paleoseismic, geomorphic, and geophysical evidence for late Pleistocene and Holocene earthquakes on shallow, south-dipping secondary faults—the Lytle Beach and Vasa Park faults—that lie within the hanging wall of the greater SFZ and are on trend with the primary, blind Blakely Harbor fault. Our data show that these structures have ruptured independently, producing localized uplift and deformation at the surface, with the most recent event (RH2) likely occurring in the early nineteenth century. While a temporal overlap between the late Pleistocene RH1 and VP1 earthquakes raises the possibility of a ≥35 km rupture along the Blakely Harbor fault, structural and temporal evidence instead supports independent rupture on individual faults related to folding. We interpret these faults as bending-moment reverse faults that formed within a synclinal hinge zone of the main fault, reflecting mechanical and kinematic influences of the broader fault system. Combined with prior studies, our findings indicate that faulting related to folding dominates the mode of strain release within the SFZ since the late Pleistocene with more frequent earthquake recurrence (∼350 yr) over the past ∼2500 yr.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The Eocene Golden Horn batholith (North Cascades, northwestern United States) is an unusual example of coeval ferroan (A-type) and I-type granitoids that formed in a subduction zone setting. Associated mafic to intermediate dikes and stocks (adakites and calc-alkaline basalts to andesites) attest to the presence of mafic magmas in the shallow crust during batholith assembly and imply anomalously hot conditions in the mantle that are attributed to rupture or rollback of the subducting slab. Field, geochemical, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data support generation of the ferroan magmas at midcrustal depth by melting of calc-alkaline plutonic rocks or by protracted differentiation of a parental basalt, and production of the I-type magmas by partial melting of gabbroic rocks at greater depth. Metasomatism by fluids bearing Na, F, and high field strength elements enriched some ferroan rocks to produce peralkaline granite. Mixing between the I-type and ferroan magmas also produced a hornblende-biotite granite with rapakivi feldspars, which is the most voluminous phase of the batholith. Results of this study suggest that ferroan granitoids rarely form in continental arcs because that tectonic regime limits voluminous basalt intrusion into the upper crust, and not because of a lack of suitable source rocks. Their presence in an arc setting likely indicates rollback or tearing of the slab or the presence of a slab window.</span>",

While existing wearable ultrasound devices, whether rigid or stretchable, often merge rigid ultrasound element arrays with soft materials to achieve a reliable interface on the human skin, they lack controlled artificial microstructures, resulting in compromised ultrasound transparency and challenges in achieving broadband focusing. Here, we report a metapad made of hydrogel metamaterials with high ultrasound transparency and broadband focusing by controlling the hydrogel porosity on a sub-wavelength scale. The hydrogel metapad achieves near-perfect acoustic impedance matching with tissues, low attenuation loss, broadband transmission, and high focusing intensity gain. Ultrasound imaging simulations further show a significant improvement in imaging contrast near the focal region when using the hydrogel metapad. Practical applications demonstrate that it enhances the imaging capabilities of ultrasound probes for vital human organs, including blood vessels and the heart. Our hydrogel metapad holds great potential for advancing soft acoustic functional devices, capable of seamlessly interfacing with both biological tissues and aquatic environments.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>The growing adoption of wearable electronics is spurring the development of lightweight, highly integrable fabric systems. These systems are required to seamlessly merge multiple functions, including energy storage, signal rectification and neuromorphic computing. However, integrating these diverse functionalities into a single fiber structure remains a significant challenge, primarily due to material compatibility issues and distinct operational mechanisms. To address this challenge, we present the novel fiber-shaped aqueous dual-ion batteries (FADIBs) composed of a CuHCF/CNTF cathode, an Ag/CNTF anode, and an NH<sub>4</sub>Cl/PVA gel electrolyte. This dual-ion configuration serves as a unified platform that inherently combines these typically disparate functions. Specifically, the FADIBs achieve a high energy density of 51.5 mWh cm<sup>-3</sup> and an exceptional ionic rectification ratio of up to 109, facilitated by asymmetric ion migration. It also emulates artificial synaptic behavior with an ultra-low energy consumption of only 7.5 fJ per synaptic event. Furthermore, the versatility of the FADIBs allows the integration into various fabric-based functional modules, demonstrating applications in energy harvesting, power supply, and synaptic-controlled electrochromic regulation. This work establishes FADIBs as a foundational technology for multifunctional integration, providing prescient insights for future fabric systems that unify energy management, intelligent perception, and information processing.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Although cluster species undergo efficient photoresponsive transformations in dilute solutions, their solid-state materials suffer severely impeded responsiveness due to insufficient motional freedom. Here we present a photochemical approach that enables spatial and temporal control over nanocluster structure/size conversions in the crystalline state. The Cu<sub>18</sub> nanocluster, whether in solution or solid form, undergoes a photoinduced transformation when exposed to 365 nm light, resulting in a size-reduced Cu<sub>14</sub> nanocluster. The single-atom alloy counterpart, Ag<sub>1</sub>Cu<sub>17</sub>, possesses a remarkably enhanced efficiency towards the photoinduced conversion to form the same cluster product. The comparable photoinduced conversion efficiencies between Cu<sub>18</sub> and Ag<sub>1</sub>Cu<sub>17</sub> are monitored by time-dependent characterizations and further rationalized by theoretical calculations. The high photoconversion efficiency of crystalline nanocluster materials allows for the precise spatial and temporal control of solid-state transformations at the micrometer scale using femtosecond cold laser technology or by controlling the irradiation time of ultraviolet light. This study introduces a novel pair of clusters with comparable photoinduced conversion characteristics, allowing for atomic-level characterizations and an in-depth understanding of the photochemical behavior of metal nanoclusters. Furthermore, the findings in this work are expected to facilitate the design of cluster-based solid-state nanomaterials for downstream photoresponsive applications.</span>",

Both models and observations include uncertainties, which must be considered when evaluating their consistency. Based on 14 ESMs and 6 observational datasets, the models&#8217; climatological annual mean oxygen matches observations well near the surface. However, significant biases remain in the tropics and in the thermocline. Based on the same set of models and three time-varying observation-based datasets, the models tend to underestimate deoxygenation trends from 1965 to 2014, except for the North Atlantic basin. However, the small number of observational datasets limits this conclusion. One dataset appears to significantly underestimate deoxygenation due to sparse data coverage. This review highlights the need for improvements in model process representations and the development of more observation-based, quality-controlled datasets to better constrain and interpret oxygen changes in the ocean.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Uncertainties of dissolved oxygen field in CMIP6 ESMs and observational reconstructions are quantified.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The ESMs can skillfully reproduce long-term average oxygen near the surface, but challenges remain in the thermocline and tropics.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The ESMs underestimates the deoxygenation trends except for the North Atlantic basin.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

Active incision in bedrock rivers sets the pace of landscape evolution because river incision cuts deep valleys and canyons into bedrock, transporting that material to the sea. This unburdens Earth's surface, allowing uplift of majestic mountain peaks in tectonically active settings. Bedrock-bound rivers, where the banks and bed are mostly bedrock, are hard points in the landscape that set the upstream base level of drainage basins and that must be vertically incised to lower landscape elevation and balance erosion against tectonic uplift. There are four distinct bedrock-bound channel morphologies that do not occur in alluvial channels&#8212;constriction-pool-widenings, rapids, overfalls, and waterfalls&#8212;each of which has a distinct flow structure. Our ability to predict bedrock-bound channel morphodynamics is nascent, but the discovery of mechanistic lateral bedrock erosion models, coupled with existing vertical incision models, allow prediction of bedrock river geometry and adjustments due to changes in water flux, sediment supply, and regional uplift.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Coupled lateral and vertical erosion models reveal that the geometry of bedrock rivers is dominantly controlled by sediment supply, not discharge.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Coupling observations of nonuniform flow structures and erosion models confirm that bedrock-bound channels are loci of intense erosion along a river's profile.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Prediction of the 3D shape of bedrock-bound rivers is possible by combining models for flow, sediment transport, and bedrock erosion.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Morphodynamic predictions are limited by poor understanding of nonuniform flow structures, flow resistance, and sediment transport in bedrock-bound channels.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

In this review we propose a multiscale perspective on multiphase magmas under crustal storage conditions, with a specific focus on phase separation mechanisms.

The purpose of this review is to make phylogenetic paleontology more accessible to a wider array of scientists and attract new researchers to the discipline. Herein, we use recently published analyses of a diverse array of fossil animals (e.g., arthropods, echinoderms, and carnivorans) to better illustrate the breadth of research questions that can be studied using phylogenetic paleoecology. Phylogenetic paleoecology has been used to discern drivers of morphological change and variations in evolutionary rates, along with the relationship between phylogeny, biogeography, and ecology. Additional avenues of research could focus on modularity and mosaicism in evolution, as well as the impact of mass extinctions and adaptive radiations. By encouraging a greater diversity of scientific backgrounds and plurality of thought, and by incorporating new perspectives from different areas of both geology and biology, the field of phylogenetic paleoecology will lead to the consideration of new questions, avenues, and possibilities that would otherwise go unexplored.</div>",

This review focuses on the potential effects of this negative vote on the humanities and social sciences by drawing on perspectives from science and society. It argues that stratigraphers&#8217; negative vote is likely to have little effect on other disciplines because most humanists and social scientists are not using the stratigraphic term. Instead, they understand the Anthropocene as shorthand for human-caused environmental change, which is clearly occurring. Humanists and social scientists also remain interested in the Anthropocene because the collapsing distinction between the human and the geological continues to present challenges worth engaging with. While the diverse interpretations and engagements with the Anthropocene may result in incoherence, this review summarizes literature that suggests that this plurality of meanings is what gives the Anthropocene concept its strength.The Anthropocene is likely to remain a key concept in the humanities and social sciences, despite stratigraphers&#8217; rejection of the epoch.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The Anthropocene means different things to different disciplines.

We also focus on the recent debate between cold and warm magma storage models, using a common conceptual framework that allows a more coherent synthesis of magma storage conditions. Evidence suggests that although most silicic crustal magmatic systems spend most of their time in a rheologically immobile state, variations exist in space and time.

Using ice core records of volcanism and tree-ring data of summer temperature anomalies, we analyze 38 preindustrial eruptions that injected an estimated 6 Tg or more of sulfur into the stratosphere. We then explore more than 100 works that consider the volcanism-climate-society nexus, teasing out the key elements of their arguments for or against the role of volcanically forced climate change in far-field societal impacts.

I have also worked across several discipline boundaries, an activity I call scientific trespassing. My career has unfolded in such unexpected ways that, like anyone's life and like the history of our planet, it can only be seen as a most improbable journey. A focus on these three concepts and on the history of geology (a traditional name used here for all the Earth sciences) leads to the understanding that geology was once the crown jewel of sciences, and that after a century of necessary but routine geologic mapping, geology now needs to resume its crown jewel role because the understanding and care of our planet is becoming humanity's most urgent task.</div>",

This review furthers Melosh's epic efforts. In pursuing both the nuclear ground shock data and supporting laboratory test data, it undertakes methods for determining and calculations of the viscosity of solid materials on the respective scales. Further, applicability of viscoelasticity in modeling the shock response on the scales of concern is demonstrated and applied. The review closes with a discussion of universal features of the shock wave viscous time history in solid materials.

But inferring such important traits (e.g., trophic position, metabolism, pathologies) in extinct animals, including humans, can be challenging because biological processes rarely mirror morphology as preserved in the fossil record. For instance, dietary behavior does not necessarily reflect tooth morphology. As an additional challenge, some isotopic mammal tissues commonly used in modern ecology, such as collagen in bone or dentine or keratin from hair, hoof, or horn, do not generally preserve in fossil remains older than &#8764;200 kyr.

    "summary": "<div>Methane (CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span>) is a simple molecule that, due to its radiative forcing, wields an outsized impact on planetary heat balance. Methane is formed by diverse abiotic pathways across a range of pressures and temperatures. Biological methanogenesis for anaerobic respiration uses a terminal nickel-containing enzyme and is limited to the archaeal domain of life. Methane can also be produced in aerobic microbes during bacterial methylphosphonate and methylamine degradation and via nonenzymatic reactions during oxidative stress. Abiotic CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> is produced via thermogenic reactions and during serpentinization reactions in the presence of metal catalysts. Reconstructions of CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> cycling over geologic time are largely inferential. Throughout Earth's history, CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> has probably been the second most important climate-forcing greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Biological methanogenesis has likely dominated CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> flux to Earth's atmosphere for the past &#8764;3.5 billion years, during which time CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> is thought to have generally declined as atmospheric oxygen has risen. Here we review the evolution of the CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> cycle over Earth's history, showcasing the multifunctional roles CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> has played in Earth's climate, prebiotic chemistry, and microbial metabolisms. We also discuss the future of Earth's atmospheric CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span>, the cycling of CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> on other planetary bodies in the Solar System (with special emphasis on Titan), and the potential of CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> as a biosignature on Earth-like extrasolar planets.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Before life arose on Earth, abundant atmospheric CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> in Earth's early atmosphere was likely key for establishment of habitable conditions and production of organic molecules for prebiotic chemistry.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Biological methanogenesis for anaerobic respiration is only known to exist in some groups of anaerobic archaea, but CH<span class=\"jp-sub\">4</span> can also be produced via enzymatic and nonenzymatic biological pathways that are not directly coupled to energy conservation.

    "summary": "<div>Intrinsic magnetic fields were once commonplace across our Solar System, and many planetary bodies have sustained active dynamos to the present day. The nature and behavior of these dynamos vary widely, however, reflecting the diverse internal conditions of planets as summarized in this review. For the terrestrial planets, the existence of active dynamos and/or ancient remanent magnetization recorded in crustal rocks, or lack thereof, lead to questions about their timing and power sources. Paleomagnetic studies reveal that many small bodies in the Solar System exhibit remanent magnetization, often attributed to ancient core dynamos with little known about the fluid dynamics. For the gas giants, their dipole-dominated magnetic fields and internal structures are relatively well-characterized, with dilute cores that are not centrally concentrated and other stable layers that likely affect the dynamo in ways that are not yet understood. For the ice giants, their multipolar magnetic fields and internal structures are unusual yet poorly constrained, to the extent that even the water-to-rock ratio is not well-known. Through adoption of a broader comparative planetology approach, the study of dynamos in exoplanets and cool stars enriches our understanding of dynamo theories.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Planetary dynamos exhibit diverse magnetic fields shaped by their distinct physical and chemical conditions.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The study of planets and stars connects planetary science, geophysics, and astrophysics, revealing shared dynamo processes.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>While significant progress has been made in understanding planetary and stellar magnetic fields, many puzzles still persist.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

    "summary": "<div>Geomagnetic methods allow us to explore the behavior of Earth's geodynamo, constrain Earth's composition and structure, and locate critical minerals and other resources essential for modern technologies and the energy transition. The magnetic properties of rocks and sediments are assumed to be stable and largely attributable to inorganic processes. This conventional view overlooks mounting evidence of microorganisms as key players in rock transformations and geological processes. Iron-bearing minerals are ubiquitous in most environments and are commonly used by microorganisms as electron donors and acceptors. Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties by creating, altering, and dissolving Fe-bearing minerals, potentially modifying the original magnetization, complicating interpretations of the magnetic record. This review provides an overview of biogenic pathways that modulate magnetic minerals and discusses common, yet underutilized, magnetic methods for capturing such behavior. Appreciating the influence of microbial activities on magnetic properties will improve our interpretations of Earth's geologic past and its elemental cycling.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microorganisms modulate rock magnetic properties, challenging traditional views of a geologically stable magnetic record formed solely by inorganic processes.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microbial iron cycling modulates magnetic properties modifying magnetic information recorded in rocks.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Microbial processes may have impacted Earth's magnetic history more deeply than previously understood.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Recognizing microbial contributions is critical for accurate interpretation of paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records and could aid in the search for life on other planetary bodies.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

    "summary": "<div>The notion of climate sensitivity has become synonymous with equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), or the equilibrium response of the Earth system to a doubling of CO<span class=\"jp-sub\">2</span>. But there is a hierarchy of measures of climate sensitivity, which can be arranged in order of increasing complexity and societal relevance and which mirror the historical development of climate modeling. Elements of this hierarchy include the well-known ECS and transient climate response and the lesser-known transient climate response to cumulative emissions and zero emissions commitment. This article describes this hierarchy of climate sensitivities and associated modeling approaches. Key concepts reviewed along the way include climate forcing and feedback, ocean heat uptake, and the airborne fraction of cumulative emissions. We employ simplified theoretical models throughout to encapsulate well-understood aspects of these quantities and to highlight gaps in our understanding and areas for future progress.\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>There is a hierarchy of measures of climate sensitivity, which exhibit a range of complexity and societal relevance.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>Equilibrium climate sensitivity is only one of these measures, and our understanding of it may have reached a plateau.\n</li>\n<li><span class=\"label\">&#9642;&#160;\n</span>The more complex measures introduce new quantities, such as ocean heat uptake coefficient and airborne fraction, which deserve increased attention.\n</li>\n</ul></div>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Silicate inclusions in chromite crystals often occur at high population densities and sometimes even share a common shape preferred orientation. These inclusions are arranged in a two-dimensional grid, herein referred to as “waffle-iron patterns” (WIPs). WIPs have been observed in the different geological contexts where chromite crystals nucleate. Their ubiquity and exotic mineralogy raise questions about their origin. Crystallographic data acquired on WIP-bearing chromite crystals demonstrate a systematic host:inclusion crystallographic orientation relationship. It is shown that WIPs result from syngrowth epitaxial nucleation of silicates onto initially skeletal chromite crystals; thus, they are markers of cryptic and transient out-of-equilibrium magmatic systems. The implication is that chromite-hosted silicate inclusions may not be reliable proxies for the early stages of magmatic systems.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The thermal structure of the lithosphere influences both the extensional and contractional phases of rift-inversion orogenesis. During the Proterozoic, elevated geotherms likely favored wide rift formation, yet examples of wide rift-inversion orogens are absent from the literature. Using 2-D thermo-mechanical models, we show that narrow rifts formed under colder initial geotherms invert into localized orogenic wedges flanked by foreland basins, largely utilizing rift architecture. Wide rifts formed under warmer initial geotherms, representing Proterozoic conditions, invert into broad, low-relief orogenic plateaus through distributed upper crustal faulting and ductile flow in the underlying lithosphere. Importantly, postrift tectonic quiescence modestly affects narrow rift inversion, primarily widening the orogenic wedge, but fundamentally alters wide rift inversion by promoting lithospheric cooling, embrittlement, and the development of deep contractional shear zones offsetting the Moho by 10−20 km. This wide rift-inversion framework may provide an explanation for distributed shortening and low topographic relief in Proterozoic orogens.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">The immediate aftermath of the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) mass extinction (ca. 66 Ma) in the marine realm was characterized by the initial recovery of productivity and the originations of new species. These major events are recorded in sediments a few centimeters above the K/Pg boundary and are typically dated via planktic foraminiferal biostratigraphy. The first Paleocene planktic foraminifer biozone is Zone P0, defined as the interval between the extinction of Cretaceous species and the first appearance of the new Paleocene taxon <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina.</span> Constraining the age of the top of the global Biochron P0 is crucial for understanding how quickly this initial diversification occurred. However, the long-accepted value, ∼30 k.y. after the boundary, is based on the assumption of constant sedimentation rates across the K/Pg boundary. We provide a new calibration for this important biostratigraphic marker using published records of <sup>3</sup>He, a proxy for instantaneous sedimentation rates, from six K/Pg boundary sites. We find Biochron P0 durations between 3.5 k.y. and 11.1 k.y., with an average of 6.4 k.y. Taxonomic concepts vary among researchers, but as many as 10 new species of planktic foraminifera have been observed within Zone P0, with many more reported at or just above its top. Based on our new calibration, the first of these new species appeared &lt;2 k.y. after the Chicxulub impact. The ages and order of these first appearances vary slightly from site to site, suggesting biogeographic differences between sites as novel taxa evolved and dispersed.</span>",

Non-isochemical interactions between country rocks and metasomatizing pegmatite-related fluids may offer crucial insights into their origin and properties. In our study of the Li-rich Volta Grande pegmatite, we draw on comprehensive geochemical exploration databases and structural volumetric strain constraints to compute representative mass balance estimates. In the exomorphic halo of the main pegmatite, an initial stage of holmquistite-dominated metasomatism can be recognized, followed by biotitization which produces a metasomatic rock with c. 80% Li-Rb-Cs-biotite. Major and trace elements in biotitite indicate alteration characterized by a volume loss factor of c. 0.94. Volume loss is compatible with structural profiles of a contact parallel reverse shear zone that overprinted metasomatism, characterized by upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies mylonitization microstructures. At these doubly constrained volume loss factors, estimates suggest that adding K and Li to the exomorphic halo accounts for approximately 3–5% and 2% by weight, respectively, of the original mass within the pegmatite. Conversely, about 10% of Ca in the pegmatite may have been drawn in from the country rocks during late-stage metasomatism. This finding is backed by textural evidence of Ca-rich phases in the pegmatite and supports growing consensus regarding open-system interactions between pegmatite-forming liquids and surrounding country rocks, which are particularly effective in causing calcium incursions into pegmatite.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Chrysocolla, historically appreciated as a vibrant blue-green pigment and gemstone, remains an unresolved issue due to its variable composition, ambiguous structural nature and inconsistent classification across literature. This study presents a comprehensive, multi-scale investigation aimed at unraveling the true nature of chrysocolla by integrating analyses, complemented by the first thermodynamic constraints for its formation. Samples from two mining localities — Capo Calamita Mine (Elba Island, Italy) and Cornwall Mine (Pennsylvania, USA) — were analyzed using a stepwise methodological approach, combining optical microscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA-WDS), Pair Distribution Function analysis (PDF) in high resolution, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Microstructural observations revealed various textural patterns: chrysocolla from the Elba Island exhibits complex arborescent and banded morphologies, often associated with malachite, while the samples from Pennsylvania display predominantly massive and banded textures intergrown with microcrystalline silica phases. Micro-Raman analyses confirmed consistent vibrational signatures of chrysocolla between the two sites but highlighted distinct mineral associations: malachite in samples from Elba Island and chalcedony (quartz and moganite) in Pennsylvania ones. EMPA results determined a basic composition with a certain constancy in the sample set, but also some significant differences: samples from Elba Island showed a higher CuO content (∼45.85 wt%), whereas chrysocolla from Pennsylvania slightly lower CuO (∼41.50 wt%) and elevated Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (∼1.31 wt%), reflecting local geological influences. PCA analysis effectively distinguished the geochemical signatures of chrysocolla from the two localities, suggesting compositional “fingerprints” linked to the specific mineralizing environments of the site. The total scattering data provided key insights into short-range structural coherence, distinguishing Si–O and Cu–O bond distances and confirming a low crystalline order, extending up to ∼10 Å. Furthermore, at the nanoscale, TEM investigations revealed that chrysocolla from both localities predominantly consists of an intricate network of randomly oriented nanotubes, diverging from prior models proposing an amorphous silica matrix embedding copper nanoparticles. Thermodynamic modelling of the system Cu–SiO<sub>2</sub>–SCOH revealed that chrysocolla stability is influenced by three main factors: (1) oxidizing conditions stabilizing Cu<sup>2+</sup>, (2) high silica chemical potential at, or above, quartz saturation, and (3) low temperatures near ambient conditions. The coexistence of malachite and chrysocolla in samples from Elba Island reflects fluid chemistry oscillations at the stability boundary between these two phases, whereas the assemblage from Pennsylvania implies silica supersaturation conditions, favoring simultaneous chrysocolla and chalcedony formation. Collectively, these findings refine our understanding of chrysocolla’s mineralogical identity, nanostructure, and formation conditions, offering valuable implications for mineral exploration and resource evaluation in copper deposits.</span>",

Few experiments have addressed the conditions of dehydration melting of carbonated rocks, despite their potential importance for carbon cycling in subduction zones and arc magmatism. Here, we present high-pressure experiments on a carbonated eclogite with H<sub>2</sub>O stored in phengite to illustrate the decarbonation behavior of subducted crust. The experimental results show that phengite-bearing carbonated eclogite undergoes silicate melting at 3–4 GPa and temperatures ∼850 °C, leaving carbonate as a refractory phase in equilibrium with eclogitic residues. At high pressures (5–8 GPa), the near-solidus liquid is replaced by carbonatitic liquid at temperatures of ∼900–950 °C. Dehydration of phengite is responsible for the formation of both silicate and carbonatitic liquids in subducted eclogite. The intersection of the carbonate melting curve with slab geotherms at depths greater than ∼150 km can produce 5–7 wt% potassium-rich carbonatitic liquids for mantle metamorphism at temperatures achievable in warm/hot subduction zones. We suggest that phengite dehydration induced carbonate melting could be an important carbon cycling mechanism in subduction zones, which could effectively remove most of the carbon in subducted eclogites.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Continental lithospheric evolution controls the surface topography, environment, and biosphere. The eastern South China Block (ESCB), affected by the flat subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate (PPP) during the Late Permian to Triassic, offers insights into the interplay between deep-Earth processes and the surface environment. However, how the flat subduction of PPP formed and regulated the lithosphere and topography remain unclear. To address these issues, ca. 243 Ma gabbroic-dioritic samples from Well NK-1, southern South China Sea, were analyzed for element, Sr-Nd isotopic, and zircon U-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions. The data are integrated with ∼3461 geochemical datasets for ca. 265−200 Ma counterpart rocks from the ESCB. The studied rocks originated from a metasomatized lithospheric mantle. All data reveal that the flat subduction of the PPP transitioned from a high-angle subduction. During this transition, the ESCB lithosphere underwent sequential thinning (ca. 265−254 Ma), thickening (ca. 253−241 Ma), and thinning (ca. 240−200 Ma), driven by lithospheric extension, compression, and mechanical erosion, respectively. The high magma migration rates (&gt;42 km/m.y.) during ca. 253−235 Ma indicate a rapid trench-ward movement of the ESCB, which, together with lithospheric thickening, probably facilitated the formation of flat-slab subduction. In addition, the reconstructed paleo-elevation patterns correlate well with the variations in lithospheric thickness of the ESCB. Correspondingly, the reduced and enhanced continental weathering was controlled by elevation lowering and rising during the Late Permian and Early Triassic, respectively, and our study shows that the elevation-controlled variable weathering rates may cause decreases and increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. These findings elucidate the feedback mechanisms linking tectonism, lithosphere, topography, and environment.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Carbon cycling mediated by magmatism is fundamental to planetary habitability, yet the role of crustal magmatism, particularly adakitic rocks, in tracing deep carbon transfer remains poorly constrained. Here, we employ coupled Fe-Mg isotopes in Early Cretaceous low-Mg (LMA) and high-Mg adakitic rocks (HMA) from northeastern China to identify the geochemical fingerprint of carbon cycling within crustal magmatism. The LMA exhibit high δ<sup>56</sup>Fe (0.14‰ to 0.23‰) and low δ<sup>26</sup>Mg (−0.40‰ to −0.28‰), whereas HMA display low δ<sup>56</sup>Fe (0.05‰ to 0.15‰) and high δ<sup>26</sup>Mg (−0.31‰ to −0.21‰). Partial melting modeling and major-element variations indicate that they originated from a carbonated eclogite source. The widespread distribution of Mesozoic adakitic rocks across northeastern China demonstrates that carbonated eclogite is a critical carbon reservoir. Temporal correlations between regional Mg isotope compilations and subducted carbon fluxes reveal that slab subduction (Paleo-Pacific plate in Mesozoic; Pacific plate in Cenozoic) facilitated carbon recycling. Our results establish adakitic rocks as robust tracers of deep carbon cycling and demonstrate that plate-tectonic processes have governed this transfer over millions of years, advancing understanding of Earth’s deep carbon cycle and its planetary habitability implications.</span>",

The Emeishan large igneous province (LIP) eruptive activity had been suggested to be the cause of the Guadalupian (Middle Permian) mass extinction event and the transition from icehouse to greenhouse climate in the Permian. However, the causal mechanism of the Emeishan LIP’s impact on the environment and mass extinction is still unresolved. This study presents &gt;300 foraminiferal species, mercury (Hg) and carbon isotopic compositions, zircon U-Pb ages, biomarkers, and elemental data across the Guadalupian-Lopingian (G-L; i.e., middle−upper Permian) boundary of South China to investigate mass extinction and the evolution of the Emeishan LIP. A precise chronological framework across the G-L boundary is reconstructed using five U-Pb age data integrated with carbon isotopic stratigraphic correlations. A U-Pb age of 260.58 ± 0.86 Ma determined using secondary ion mass spectrometry from a section of continuous deposition is suggested as a revised age for the G-L boundary. Organic carbon isotopic composition (δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>org</sub>) and Hg geochemistry data show three pulses of Emeishan LIP eruptive activity in the earliest Wordian, in the middle Capitanian, and at the G-L boundary, respectively. The second and third pulses of the Emeishan LIP eruptive activity in the middle Capitanian and at the G-L boundary, respectively, coincided with two stages of the Guadalupian mass extinction, demonstrating a causal link. The Emeishan LIP eruptive activity probably caused the Guadalupian mass extinction by triggering marine anoxia and global warming.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Late Paleogene loess formed during a period of active regional tectonism and global climate cooling. Although Oligocene loess has been documented in central Asia and North and South America, it remains unclear whether the earliest appearances of loess were simultaneous across all regions before the Eocene−Oligocene cooling and whether they provided feedback on global climate during this time. This study examines the earliest appearance of late Paleogene loess at Flagstaff Rim in Wyoming, western United States, by integrating detailed sedimentologic characterization with both supervised and unsupervised machine learning models. Integrating grain-size patterns and field sedimentological features in the upper Eocene−Oligocene White River Formation led to the identification of four depositional processes, which were further supported by two unsupervised machine learning methods. The four patterns reflect primary loess, pedogenically modified loess, fluvial reworked loess and/or mixed dust-sand storm deposits, and fluvial sediments. Loess deposition occurred during active fluvial process as early as 35.8 Ma, 0.5 m.y. earlier than the apparent lithofacies change. By using the geological classifications as predefined labels, we trained four supervised machine learning models to identify loess from the grain-size data from other sites of the White River Formation (Group) in the western United States. Our multilayer perceptron (MLP) model achieved the best performance and predicted pedogenically modified loess and earlier starts of loess accumulation than previously thought at two of the sites. This study suggests that loess coverage in the western United States was significant before the drastic cooling at the Eocene−Oligocene transition, similar to loess in central Asia. Wind transport of loess and finer dust could have served as feedback on the latest Eocene global cooling. Additionally, this study demonstrates that using machine learning to analyze grain-size patterns not only helps interpret depositional processes but also identifies new features in the dataset that facilitate the formulation of new hypotheses for further investigation.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\">Magmatic flare-ups are widely recognized as pivotal features of continental arc magmatism, yet their driving mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new radiometric ages and geochemical data for normal calc-alkaline, high-magnesian, and Nb-enriched arc magmatic rocks from the Northern Yili Arc (Western Tianshan, China), which coincide with the Late Devonian magmatic flare-up in the region. The normal arc magmatic rocks likely originated from partial melting of a slab fluid-metasomatized mantle wedge, possibly accompanied by fractional crystallization and crustal assimilation processes. In contrast, the high-magnesian andesites (HMAs) and Nb-enriched basalts (NEBs) were derived from sediment melt and slab melt-metasomatized mantle sources, respectively. The systematic decoupling of Nd-Hf isotopes in contemporaneous mafic-intermediate lavas further indicates mantle source heterogeneity. The clustered eruption of HMAs and NEBs, alongside enriched continental signatures in their mantle sources, implies intensified slab-mantle interactions. We attribute this to enhanced interaction efficiency driven by a unique geodynamic process. We propose that the most plausible mechanism for the Late Devonian−Early Carboniferous magmatic fluctuations involves seamount/oceanic plateau subduction followed by slab retreat or rollback. The Late Devonian seamount subduction scenario provides new insights into the geodynamic evolution of the North Tianshan Ocean, the distribution of Au-Cu deposits, and the polarity of subduction in ancient oceanic plates within the Yili microcontinent.</span>",

Current approaches encode initial conditions into physical invariants to guide the solution of various equations, but these static physical invariants capture only short-term dynamics and fail to represent long-term evolution, which degrades both accuracy and stability over time. In this paper, we introduce the Sliding Physical Invariant Neural Operator (SPINO), which integrates physical invariants that slide dynamically with the evolution of the underlying PDEs. Compared with existing methods, our approach achieves substantial error reductions of 34.3%-79.8% in the training domain and 7.7%-76.5% in the future domain, underscoring its markedly enhanced generalization and long-term predictive performance across a wide range of PDE scenarios.</span>",

Here we demonstrate that pressure uniquely enhances the optoelectronic performance of boron-rich semiconductor AlCu<sub>1-δ</sub>B<sub>25</sub> via an unconventional anti-Wilson effect. Under compression, the photocurrent of AlCu<sub>1-δ</sub>B<sub>25</sub> increases by more than twenty-fold, to ∼7.22 μA at 26.5 GPa, while the dark current reduces dramatically by nearly four orders of magnitude (to ∼0.2 nA), yielding an unprecedented improvement in on/off ratio exceeding 10<sup>5</sup>-fold. Simultaneously, pressure significantly accelerates the optoelectronic response, reducing the response time by three orders of magnitude. Optical absorption measurements reveal an anomalous pressure-driven anti-Wilson effect in AlCu<sub>1-δ</sub>B<sub>25</sub>. First-principles calculations indicate that this anomaly arises from an upward shift of Al-3<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">s</span> states through interactions with B-2<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">s</span> electrons.

However, systematic investigations of both the coupling and ballistics in such artificially assembled systems remain scarce. Here, we report collective quantum coherence in a quasi-2D film consisting of well-aligned single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with intertube coupling. The conductance plateau in the quasi-ballistic regime demonstrates subband occupation of hundreds of CNTs in a collective manner. The experimental observations agree with density functional theory simulations considering subband redistribution with intertube coupling. Finally, we summarize the quantum coherent transport for multichannel coupled systems in distinct regimes. These results open an avenue towards exploring engineered artificial systems for coherent electronic devices and hold potential for the development of novel high-performance and quantum nanoelectronics.</span>",

The hydroxylation reaction of alkenes represents a convenient approach for synthesizing such molecules. However, a general and direct method featuring a broad substrate scope and good functional group tolerance remains elusive. Herein, we report our efforts in applying electrochemistry to accomplish the hydroxylation of alkenes utilizing H<sub>2</sub>O as the sole source of hydroxyl without the need for stoichiometric oxidants and strong acidic reagents. This process operates via the formation of a high-valence cobalt (IV) intermediate, which could readily be entrapped by water to deliver the desired alcohols product. Mechanistic studies, cyclic voltammetry analysis and density functional theory calculations have been conducted to verify the feasibility of cobalt valence changes, including the generation of cobalt hydride species, the formation of intermediates after hydrogen atom transfer, the reasonable oxidation potential from Co (III) to Co (IV), which substantiate the proposed reaction pathways. Furthermore, the late-stage modification of biorelevant molecules has demonstrated the promising potential applications of this approach in synthetic chemistry.</span>",

    "summary": "<span class=\"paragraphSection\"><div class=\"boxTitle\">Abstract</div>Developing nano-iontronic devices that minimize ionic interference is essential for precise measurements in complex physiological systems. Graphdiyne (GDY), a novel carbon allotrope featuring sub-nanometer pores, enables effective regulation of ionic transport and is therefore a promising material for high-performance iontronic applications. Here, we report a pH-responsive nano-iontronic device fabricated by stacking and overlapping graphdiyne (so-GDY) layers onto the tip of the nanopipette. This so-GDY-based pH nano-iontronic sensor exhibits a linear decrease in ionic current under negative potential as the pH decreases from 8.00 to 5.50. This response is attributed to protonation of the oxygen-containing functional groups on the so-GDY surface and edges, which diminishes the negative surface charge and thereby reduces ionic conductivity. A key advantage of this nano-iontronic device is its excellent selectivity, demonstrating robust resistance to interference from divalent cations (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺) and small molecules within the pH range 8.00-5.50, while maintaining stable detection currents. The so-GDY-based pH nano-iontronic device achieves typical monovalent-to-divalent cation selectivity ratio (&lt;0.4), alongside excellent repeatability, reversibility, and stability. This combination of features yields a biocompatible, high-resolution tool for minimally invasive, real-time pH measurements at the single-cell and even at a single-organelle level, opening new avenues for investigating cellular dynamics and disease pathogenesis with enhanced clarity.</span>",
